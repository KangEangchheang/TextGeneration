00:00:00.799 the lore of Elden ring is
00:00:03.200 fascinating and yet its sheer size and
00:00:05.640 complexity whether looking at the
00:00:07.359 actions of individuals like Amica and
00:00:09.400 her demigod family all piecing together
00:00:11.840 the fabric of the magical universe
00:00:13.880 itself mean there are still a ton of
00:00:16.039 mysteries and secrets yet to be answered
00:00:18.760 our thoughts are still evolving even
00:00:20.519 after years of work this law video is a
00:00:23.519 compilation of all our dives into the
00:00:25.519 world of Elden ring perfect for slow
00:00:27.920 work days or to sleep too we we' even
00:00:30.240 added a couple of our more relaxed law
00:00:31.960 before bed episodes at the end and
00:00:34.280 hopefully it can help you find some of
00:00:36.079 the answers to the law you've been
00:00:37.559 looking for in this video we cover
00:00:40.280 various fundamentals of the structure of
00:00:42.239 the lands between such as the importance
00:00:44.520 of color snakes or the Earth tree some
00:00:47.600 unique factions such as the perfumers as
00:00:50.640 well as the tales of various unique
00:00:52.800 characters if you love Elden ring and
00:00:55.120 Souls law consider liking the video and
00:00:57.800 subscribing as it really helps
00:01:01.860 [Applause]
00:01:06.840 what makes us tarnished being dull of
00:01:10.400 color the grace of gold blessed those
00:01:13.040 who were first to serve it with most
00:01:15.400 Vivid coloration morgot sword his sealed
00:01:18.920 Omen blood is of Shifting Hue the mirror
00:01:22.200 Helm reflects all light and colors
00:01:25.040 Marica is a carrier of the Elden Ring's
00:01:27.640 Vision the greater will and its vassels
00:01:30.400 are masters of the language of light the
00:01:33.680 fallen leaves tell a story and it is a
00:01:36.799 story of color color is so variable in
00:01:40.600 our world we didn't see what was in
00:01:42.280 plain sight in the lands between color
00:01:45.280 means much more and once you start to
00:01:47.840 see you cannot stop the Mad taint of
00:01:52.119 their new found strength the Knight of
00:01:54.600 black knives Scarlet rot Amber eggs
00:01:58.799 purple Mariners blood dynasties Omens
00:02:01.960 aloric Giants Gods color takes Cent a
00:02:05.759 place wherever you look it is also a
00:02:08.440 focus in a sea of item descriptions the
00:02:11.360 word color is mentioned over and over
00:02:14.519 Hue even more
00:02:16.239 often Reds yellows greens purples Blues
00:02:21.360 every tone every Hue color again and
00:02:25.720 again and again like an obsession and
00:02:28.680 more than anything an infactuation
00:02:31.680 with
00:02:34.200 gold color the pillars of the world of
00:02:37.519 Elden
00:02:38.519 ring color is connected with all
00:02:41.239 fundamental aspects of the lands between
00:02:43.760 and these connections are in a
00:02:45.519 discoverable pattern all things physical
00:02:48.360 energetic informational emotional and
00:02:51.280 spiritual in the Elden ring world are
00:02:53.360 paired with color a unifying natural law
00:02:58.360 these base Natures are what what's being
00:03:00.280 represented by the Elden ring and these
00:03:02.519 overlapping and intersecting runes it
00:03:05.599 gets a little bit more complicated than
00:03:07.519 that and we are going to get into it
00:03:10.360 because if we understand color as a
00:03:12.560 foundation we can understand the entire
00:03:16.000 law of Elden ring more
00:03:21.120 clearly how will we solve the mystery of
00:03:24.000 color it is clear Alchemy was an
00:03:26.239 influence color holds great importance
00:03:28.640 in alchemy as does gold one famous
00:03:31.879 Alchemist gave us the splitting of
00:03:33.840 colors and their relations blue borders
00:03:37.080 green which goes to Yellow to Red to
00:03:40.280 purple always moving through all
00:03:42.720 possible
00:03:43.760 Shades another renowned scientist James
00:03:46.640 Clark Maxwell discovered that unlike the
00:03:49.480 mixing of paints that artists use the
00:03:52.079 fundamental colors of light registered
00:03:54.159 in the human eye are red green and blue
00:03:57.840 this gave him the insight to make the
00:03:59.400 first first color photograph modern
00:04:02.120 science has since proven the eye
00:04:03.959 sensitivity to these three base colors
00:04:06.720 and it is the combinations of red green
00:04:09.280 and blue that make every color on the
00:04:11.439 digital screens you're watching on the
00:04:13.959 system of additive color how the colors
00:04:16.519 of light work and how colors mix within
00:04:19.399 light that Maxwell is credited as having
00:04:21.759 a founding role in is the color system
00:04:24.320 we use here while the paint color
00:04:26.759 relations are mostly similar to light
00:04:28.960 color relations light color mixing is
00:04:31.759 additive whereas paints are not show all
00:04:35.120 colors at once in light and you get
00:04:37.520 white unlike with paints but it is light
00:04:41.840 we deal with in the lands between
00:04:44.199 languages of light and obsessions with
00:04:46.759 what the eyes see so we will use the
00:04:49.639 true light color relations in this
00:04:52.080 analysis how different perceptions of
00:04:54.280 color may change perceptions of reality
00:04:56.960 or reality itself is worthy of spec
00:05:00.160 population with that we will look at the
00:05:02.360 lands between itself for evidence since
00:05:05.160 Inspirations only go so far and they are
00:05:07.800 numerous and mix unpredictably we have
00:05:10.840 to begin as if we have woken up in the
00:05:13.199 lands between and use what we see around
00:05:15.479 us to guide us one difficulty is that
00:05:18.880 there are other foundational laws in
00:05:20.400 Elden ring which all mix and interfere
00:05:23.360 another challenge is that color isn't
00:05:25.240 surface deep we will have to isolate and
00:05:28.280 simplify we must find colors in basic
00:05:31.120 and simple forms to understand then we
00:05:34.199 will earn a key to the complex law
00:05:37.759 colors are of course a useful tool in
00:05:39.639 game design used to form associations
00:05:41.840 for the player and help the
00:05:43.240 understandability of the world this is
00:05:45.360 why Health mana and stamina are almost
00:05:48.240 always depicted in games as red blue and
00:05:50.960 green respectively however in Elden ring
00:05:53.919 colors are far more important featuring
00:05:56.400 heavily in the law and May in fact be an
00:05:58.840 integral part of the rules of the world
00:06:01.280 rather than just a symptom of them
00:06:03.639 eventually we will understand why
00:06:05.520 looking into another's eyes is so
00:06:07.479 intimate why we cannot dye our clothes
00:06:10.199 and other color why Radigan was ashamed
00:06:12.880 of his hair why Godfrey needed SOS to be
00:06:16.039 a Lord why the Alban orics are so weak
00:06:19.360 why melania's rot is Scarlet why Redan
00:06:22.599 needs purple to keep his beloved horse
00:06:25.560 why the frenzy flame is yellow why
00:06:28.319 multicolored is so V vital and
00:06:31.599 understand the Enigma of gold the
00:06:34.560 obsession that haunts Mad Men Nobles and
00:06:39.479 gods all this color will lead out of the
00:06:42.240 lands between past the Stars past the
00:06:45.919 void past even the gods it leads beyond
00:06:49.720 the creative work itself to ourselves
00:06:53.400 after all what if the lands between was
00:06:56.039 an inner world if this work of art is
00:06:59.000 about what feels to be human body mind
00:07:02.160 and soul then by learning about color we
00:07:04.919 can learn about ourselves and with
00:07:07.840 learning and the grace of Good Fortune
00:07:10.080 we ourselves may rise to a future that
00:07:12.400 is bathed in
00:07:19.639 Gold red
00:07:22.879 Crimson Scarlet
00:07:26.000 flame
00:07:27.520 Giants rot
00:07:30.759 and
00:07:33.039 blood what is this color's place in the
00:07:35.759 rules of the world what effects Magics
00:07:39.919 emotions is it connected with for this
00:07:42.280 first color we will take a deep dive
00:07:44.120 into the proof in the world as we move
00:07:46.599 through the colors we will not be so
00:07:48.159 exhaustive but those who are curious can
00:07:50.159 search to find what we
00:07:52.080 have the first place to look is where we
00:07:54.720 can find Red's nature the clearest where
00:07:57.440 is red in a pure form an unmixed form
00:08:00.960 away from interference in the simplest
00:08:03.919 items we use most often one of the first
00:08:06.759 items is flask of crimson tears tears
00:08:10.120 like all blessings from the earth tree
00:08:11.840 come in different colors but the red
00:08:14.159 tears we couldn't live without they
00:08:16.800 replenish your HP the Vitality of your
00:08:20.080 player character we can also bring
00:08:22.400 torrent back to life with Crimson tears
00:08:24.879 other Crimson things in game also affect
00:08:27.240 HP Crimson Amber medallion red scarabs
00:08:30.879 and Crimson seeds among others exalted
00:08:34.000 flesh treasured by Heroes is red meat in
00:08:37.360 a medicinal solution of fiery red spices
00:08:40.599 it gives you the raw power of a beast
00:08:42.839 boosting your attack output these things
00:08:45.480 taken together make us think of bodily
00:08:47.959 Vitality red is needed to have a healthy
00:08:50.600 body red is physical life to interact
00:08:54.279 with the physical world via physical
00:08:56.080 means you need red to restore that
00:08:58.440 energy red is a color our own world
00:09:01.000 Associates with health Youth and
00:09:03.200 strength in alchemy red was believed to
00:09:05.680 have these properties and the coveted
00:09:07.600 philosopher stone which gave eternal
00:09:09.680 life is depicted as a vivid Crimson
00:09:12.800 other items in Elden ring link to this
00:09:15.000 idea of Vitality the red feathered
00:09:17.480 Branch sword raises the power of your
00:09:19.399 attacks all types of invigorating meat
00:09:22.200 which are always pickled in a red
00:09:23.920 medicinal solution boost our robustness
00:09:26.920 which help against buildups of frost and
00:09:29.399 blood loss now if a doctor in our world
00:09:32.600 had matching colored medicines for
00:09:34.560 symptoms you would choose to go to a
00:09:36.720 different doctor but in Elden ring it
00:09:39.079 really works the correlation between red
00:09:41.959 and the same boosting effects even
00:09:43.880 carries across cultures horn charms made
00:09:46.880 by The ancestral followers a different
00:09:49.040 Society to the Earth tree come in Many
00:09:51.279 Colors the one that is pure red boosts
00:09:54.720 robustness red has a true nature and is
00:09:57.760 a fundamental aspect of the World
00:09:59.839 regardless of
00:10:02.079 culture what is the next red that is
00:10:04.519 essential in Elden ring essential yet
00:10:08.160 forbidden fire fire is diverse in Elden
00:10:11.920 ring but in one way more than any other
00:10:15.480 color some Flames are more like
00:10:18.040 lightning some are lilac some are
00:10:20.680 ghostly yellow or black all the Flames
00:10:23.800 have different attributes that once
00:10:25.959 again match with color for now though we
00:10:28.959 will look at at red fire red fire in
00:10:31.160 Elden ring is more like fire in our
00:10:33.240 world intense destructive lifegiving
00:10:37.600 essential beautiful tempting fire itself
00:10:42.200 is not unlike bodily Vitality the warmth
00:10:45.880 of a champion both carry increasing heat
00:10:49.160 with increasing energy after all we seem
00:10:51.959 to reanimate the ancestor Spirits with
00:10:54.360 fire both are hard to control as they
00:10:56.880 increase in energy but is red fire just
00:11:00.200 as fire is red is color a true law of
00:11:03.880 the world as opposed to a correlation
00:11:07.040 let's look at the clues left in game
00:11:09.680 starting with medicines made often via
00:11:12.079 cookbooks we can isolate the ingredients
00:11:14.720 many medicines are heart and liver-based
00:11:16.880 another Alchemy inspired rule eat liver
00:11:19.880 to purify hearts for Vigor and so on you
00:11:23.399 will gain the nature of what you eat so
00:11:26.120 too in Elden ring of the various colored
00:11:29.320 good livers in game one is called
00:11:31.600 fireproof dried liver and it is made
00:11:34.279 with red medicinal solution another set
00:11:37.360 of items with sets of colors are the
00:11:39.240 Drake talismans they all have a
00:11:41.240 different color but the one that boosts
00:11:43.120 fire damage negation is red what about
00:11:46.200 the Giants they were the Protectors of
00:11:48.519 perhaps the most important fire in game
00:11:51.279 the Giants Forge their fire nature is
00:11:54.240 within them their hair and eyes are red
00:11:57.320 this is not only as a representation
00:11:59.800 the fire and redness is truly within
00:12:02.040 them within the redness we can find and
00:12:05.440 hold this hair in our hands Giant's red
00:12:08.440 braid and it does fire damage fire
00:12:12.399 grease of course adds damage to a weapon
00:12:14.880 and is a vivid red in our world
00:12:17.639 flammable grease or oil would be
00:12:19.880 unlikely to follow these color patterns
00:12:22.519 and it doesn't but in Elden ring they
00:12:24.959 always match and across other colored
00:12:27.560 greases and their nature
00:12:30.160 another notorious connection to Red is
00:12:32.440 blood blood is one of the engines of
00:12:35.240 bodily Vigor in our world eating red
00:12:38.000 fruits wouldn't change your amount of
00:12:39.720 blood or energy more than any other
00:12:41.680 fruit yet this is not what we find in
00:12:44.000 Elden ring consumables when they are
00:12:46.519 minimal and simplistic once again follow
00:12:49.040 a pattern staunching boluses which
00:12:51.880 alleviate impending blood loss are red
00:12:55.120 blood sorcery and blood magic are red
00:12:58.360 blood Grease is blood colored and blood
00:13:01.160 will take us to more color insights what
00:13:04.240 has strong blood Rich red
00:13:07.800 blood beasts Rich Untamed life is red
00:13:13.639 vigorous life is deep red red is the
00:13:17.120 Beast the animal the flesh side of the
00:13:20.120 human those deep red or built of a red
00:13:23.440 closer to wildness exhibit beast-like
00:13:26.600 Transformations MOG Sprouts wings
00:13:29.720 Crucible Knights who are infamously red
00:13:31.880 tinted Sprout horns wings and can use
00:13:34.959 the power of many beasts certain Reds
00:13:38.160 link these aspects together all at once
00:13:41.040 red glint Stone boosts Thorn sorceries
00:13:43.600 and lava sorceries blood and fire blood
00:13:47.760 flame is the same pairing of Reds and
00:13:50.560 mogg's own blood bursts into flame in
00:13:53.160 his boss fight this also happened when
00:13:55.880 he stood before the formless mother his
00:13:58.279 accursed blood blood erupted with fire
00:14:01.680 blood and fire both red are not so
00:14:05.040 different in nature red pairs up blood
00:14:08.480 and heat in the trait of robustness all
00:14:11.199 the medicinal solutions that help
00:14:12.920 robustness are red what is the use of
00:14:15.959 robustness it helps prevent buildup of
00:14:18.560 frost and blood loss the Giants are fire
00:14:22.279 and with such internal heat they can
00:14:24.279 survive cold regions and with abundant
00:14:27.199 Vitality blood loss is more
00:14:29.560 manageable if we join M's blood cult we
00:14:32.480 have a color affect our own character
00:14:35.199 our eyes glow red it may also affect our
00:14:38.560 view of the world as a true followers
00:14:40.759 hunt for blood will become a mental
00:14:42.839 Obsession this eye color just like the
00:14:45.360 color of armors medin spells has a
00:14:48.720 causative Connection in the game it is a
00:14:51.440 law of the world it therefore is not a
00:14:54.199 fashion option we cannot change it at
00:14:56.639 will it would change the law of the game
00:14:59.800 fundamentally our eyes become our nature
00:15:02.880 which is paired in Elden ring with
00:15:06.000 color yet red doesn't only link with
00:15:09.279 flame blood vitality and so on it also
00:15:13.079 connects with harder to Define things
00:15:15.600 red has a shared quality with emotions
00:15:18.759 desires
00:15:20.399 Sensations emotions are enormously
00:15:22.839 important in nelden ring nearly every
00:15:25.120 ending is defined most by its emotion
00:15:28.519 fear
00:15:30.759 doubt
00:15:32.319 loneliness grief
00:15:35.440 despair
00:15:37.519 Mania what emotions would be paired with
00:15:40.120 red in Elden ring emotions that are
00:15:43.600 instinctive Primal animal beast-like
00:15:47.959 emotions these emotions are messy hard
00:15:50.759 to control and Ill adapted to society if
00:15:54.360 color was only color would a God be
00:15:56.720 ashamed of his red hair
00:15:59.480 Beast blood is a rich red and beasts are
00:16:02.519 red natured those closer to animal
00:16:05.199 emotions are closer to Red emotions they
00:16:08.360 lack self-control or regulation they do
00:16:11.040 not possess enough intelligence to
00:16:12.839 understand or override their Instinct
00:16:15.680 beasts are aggressive as well as the
00:16:17.959 obvious signs of aggression in battle
00:16:20.120 they also Roar when they fight something
00:16:22.839 very unique to beasts and those of a
00:16:25.160 beast-like nature run Bears Roar but so
00:16:28.560 too to the red fire Giants Malik or gank
00:16:32.959 and SOS RS until he is made
00:16:37.120 silent these types of nature are also
00:16:39.920 useful there are benefits such as in
00:16:42.759 battle
00:16:44.519 well Thou Art of passing skill Warrior
00:16:48.759 blood must truly run in thy veins after
00:16:52.839 all rigan's glory burned as red as his
00:16:56.120 hair which leads us to another success
00:16:58.440 story that Drew from a well of red
00:17:01.759 Godfrey he waged War all the way to
00:17:04.720 become Elden Lord his strength was
00:17:08.039 unmatched but these emotions had their
00:17:10.480 time and place and once Elden Lord they
00:17:13.439 no longer had a place in the capital
00:17:15.880 when we meet him Godfrey maintains his
00:17:18.319 lordly nature at first he does not Roar
00:17:21.679 his wildness contained in his beastial
00:17:24.119 other half this side of him sash does
00:17:27.400 Roar but Godfrey talks to us relatively
00:17:30.080 calmly before the fight when he is
00:17:32.400 pushed to his limit however red has a
00:17:34.799 place once more he is then not content
00:17:37.480 to have his Beast his aggressive side
00:17:39.840 held separate to him he wants his
00:17:41.960 beastial nature within
00:17:44.640 him he slays sash becoming his true
00:17:47.799 nature once more the deep red blood
00:17:50.799 splashes all over him staining him now
00:17:54.760 beastial and blood red he
00:17:57.400 Roars his breath breath and body so hot
00:18:00.640 they steam even in the air of the
00:18:02.640 burning her
00:18:04.480 tree he charges us like a beast using
00:18:07.679 only his bare
00:18:16.500 [Music]
00:18:22.080 hands so another red emotion is
00:18:25.440 aggression a clear sign of this is the
00:18:27.960 jellyfish these young sisters change
00:18:30.360 color when they become aggressive to Red
00:18:33.760 aggressive Invaders have always been red
00:18:36.720 blood boil aromatic from a totally
00:18:39.080 different sect to beasts is Rich red
00:18:42.520 consuming it increases your damage
00:18:44.440 output but also your damage taken at
00:18:47.440 first this seems to be odd until you
00:18:49.360 read the description it puts those who
00:18:51.760 consume it into a frenzy Berserker like
00:18:55.520 Beast like linked to aggression is the
00:18:58.880 competitive urge ambition the desire for
00:19:01.960 power dominance possession competitive
00:19:05.159 summon signs are red the red Effigy is
00:19:08.799 competitive the true horu fought for a
00:19:11.480 crown and on defeat tells us our
00:19:13.880 strength deserves one Brave
00:19:17.840 tarnished thy strength beit the
00:19:23.120 crown we were told this law before the
00:19:25.600 game came out emboldened by the flame of
00:19:30.559 ambition someone must
00:19:34.000 extinguish thy
00:19:36.240 flame aggressive competitiveness that
00:19:38.840 puts the person at risk cannot be
00:19:40.720 unlocked without the red emotion of
00:19:42.679 confidence unquestioned by intellect
00:19:45.720 innate and animal confidence is red
00:19:48.919 Godfree doesn't worry about his enemies
00:19:51.159 he seeks them out he even strips his own
00:19:54.960 armor this confidence doesn't question
00:19:58.120 it knows
00:19:59.760 and confidence brings us to another
00:20:02.400 emotion Faith what is knowing
00:20:05.880 confidently a knowing you feel within
00:20:08.320 you instinctively what is knowing
00:20:10.919 without thought intellect or proof Faith
00:20:15.240 this deep feeling or trust we believe is
00:20:18.080 a red emotion it is confidence not only
00:20:20.960 in oneself but in things that are outer
00:20:23.840 fate Gods magic the red wolf of rigan
00:20:28.000 can use typical sorceries but also red
00:20:31.200 sorceries red sorceries draw on the
00:20:33.720 power of Faith these spells are reviled
00:20:36.919 by other sorcerers who prefer
00:20:38.600 intelligence as a casting Source red
00:20:41.320 glint Stone itself draws from faith not
00:20:44.400 intelligence rigan holds Faith to this
00:20:47.159 day while rigan's wife announces those
00:20:50.400 Blissful early days of blind belief a
00:20:53.240 long path he has Faith to the very end
00:20:57.039 he tries to hammer the Elden ring back
00:20:58.640 back together and dies protecting
00:21:01.400 it faith is having a gut feeling it is
00:21:05.360 red unquestioned and unreasoned belief
00:21:09.000 is the opposite to reason-based
00:21:11.559 intelligence faith can also be a
00:21:13.520 celebration of an object of Faith but we
00:21:16.640 will get to those incantations
00:21:19.279 later one emotion supposedly absent in
00:21:22.400 the lands between must be read last the
00:21:26.400 urge to reproduce is is Primal and
00:21:29.760 instinctive and it has waned since long
00:21:32.559 ago the food for boosting virility is an
00:21:35.720 untreated bright red blood and flesh no
00:21:39.640 bloodless meat for this effect this can
00:21:42.279 bring back the feelings those in the
00:21:43.880 lands between had long ago a more animal
00:21:47.400 nature but now things red have faded and
00:21:51.080 red emotions have gone the way of The
00:21:52.919 Crucible nights once useful and
00:21:55.480 essential the knights colored a red of
00:21:58.080 the past represent that mix of life and
00:22:01.520 vitality Now red is looked down upon and
00:22:04.880 viewed as uncultured urges are repressed
00:22:08.200 or simply cease to be as Society
00:22:10.919 develops beyond their
00:22:12.919 need these red emotions form a pattern
00:22:16.640 they go against
00:22:18.480 civilization aggression ruthless
00:22:21.440 competitive
00:22:22.679 desire anger physical power raw blind
00:22:28.120 confidence idence these are not so
00:22:30.240 useful in developed
00:22:33.520 Society to quote Elden Ring's own
00:22:36.039 assessment in ruler's mask such a mask
00:22:38.880 illustrates the qualities of an ideal
00:22:40.760 Lord chiefly wise and possessing a
00:22:43.840 certain defanged
00:22:46.279 geniality red is certainly not defanged
00:22:49.919 and a lord is a representation of high
00:22:52.559 society red emotions will get you in
00:22:54.880 trouble if left unchecked those in
00:22:57.679 society show their disregard for red
00:23:00.039 with their clothes it is a symbol of
00:23:02.400 wildness just as vestiges of The
00:23:04.559 Crucible are both are now increasingly
00:23:07.360 disdained as an impurity as civilization
00:23:10.200 has advanced those in the capital do not
00:23:12.880 want to wear things that boost their
00:23:14.520 beastial nature those who are exiled
00:23:17.480 however are given clothes to wear that
00:23:19.159 mark them as not fit for society what is
00:23:22.360 the color of the Exile robe red the
00:23:25.720 Exile Hood red what is the color of
00:23:29.039 those exiled for heresy a deep red sage
00:23:33.120 hood is burgundy and is literally
00:23:35.840 evidence the weara was driven from town
00:23:38.960 red is a signal of a social
00:23:41.480 reject there are more mysterious uses of
00:23:44.799 red why is the bolt that pierces Mar red
00:23:48.799 is this because her physical body must
00:23:50.760 be pinned down by Red by the bodily and
00:23:54.000 physical nature of red and what does the
00:23:56.600 red of the two fingers tell us what can
00:23:59.039 we draw from the red that spills out
00:24:00.840 after Ronnie slays her two fingers are
00:24:03.640 the two fingers the physical aspect of
00:24:05.880 something greater the body of the
00:24:08.200 greater will yet for all the risks of
00:24:11.200 red who could do without it for many a
00:24:14.400 life without red wouldn't be worth
00:24:17.240 living in its most wild State red is
00:24:21.360 similar to and in fact borders another
00:24:25.120 Infamous color but first Red's opposite
00:24:30.430 [Music]
00:24:53.399 blue blue in any miazaki game brings one
00:24:56.600 thing to mind sorcery the color of
00:24:59.840 sorceries are like all of Elden ring
00:25:02.039 very varied some sorceries are cast with
00:25:04.679 faith but almost all are cast with
00:25:07.919 intelligence these intelligent spells
00:25:10.200 are ranges of blue the first thought is
00:25:13.039 that blue is the color of the mind of
00:25:15.200 the intellect and perhaps of the Soul
00:25:18.399 let's see if this intuition is right and
00:25:20.799 if so what else does this color do what
00:25:23.799 does this color help harm and what are
00:25:26.320 the blue emotions
00:25:28.520 blue makes its appearance as one of the
00:25:30.240 first items we find flask of Cerulean
00:25:33.360 tears it replenishes your focus points
00:25:36.799 focus is the engine of the intellect
00:25:39.520 Focus points are used to cast spells
00:25:41.880 activate skills and much more the navy
00:25:44.880 blue Hood simply from its color
00:25:47.159 increases mind magic grease magic
00:25:50.360 scorpion blue liver shimmering Hearts
00:25:53.399 all affect magic damage all are blue the
00:25:57.600 blue Aran Regal scepter enhances full
00:26:00.360 moon sorceries and only those of the
00:26:03.279 highest intelligence can wield it it is
00:26:06.080 all mental power blue is the color of
00:26:09.480 the Mind intellect
00:26:12.919 Focus the characters of the world
00:26:15.200 confirm this as they become more and
00:26:17.399 more intellect focused it reflects in
00:26:19.760 their colors Rani is no longer connected
00:26:22.640 to her body and she is permanently blue
00:26:25.760 she is also cold with literal ice
00:26:28.799 crystals under her hat luc's brain has
00:26:31.960 become almost inorganic it is so far
00:26:34.640 from Red life his new head has a deep
00:26:37.679 blue within it the Mind's Eye of AEL a
00:26:41.520 star being is
00:26:43.559 blue of course the center of blue on the
00:26:46.399 map is the academy surrounded by Mists
00:26:49.640 and Waters bathing in a night sky of the
00:26:52.679 Moon their robes are blue their spells
00:26:55.880 are blue the very mist and Air around
00:26:58.640 the academy has a blue tint ral's robe
00:27:01.640 is blue the realm we are taken to in the
00:27:04.240 boss fight is a realm of water star and
00:27:07.120 moon all of it shades of blue the nature
00:27:10.960 of the place designed for intellectual
00:27:13.440 growth and learning the other heads of
00:27:16.200 sorcery the Karan royal family even have
00:27:19.000 their own shade Karan blue their royal
00:27:22.200 castle is lit with blue flame with blue
00:27:25.520 crystals growing in an air alive with
00:27:27.880 blue
00:27:28.679 Sparks just as red is organic life blue
00:27:32.480 is intellectual life but inorganic we
00:27:36.200 see this clearly in the nature of glint
00:27:38.399 ststone hard inert yet able to Spring
00:27:41.960 forth action and energy the inert
00:27:45.000 non-living nature of the mind is shown
00:27:47.159 by Lu sap as he descends more and more
00:27:50.120 into a meditative intellectual world he
00:27:52.799 becomes physically different and less
00:27:55.080 and less like typical animal life Luc
00:27:58.240 Clint ststone Crown says this crown
00:28:00.320 replaced luc's brain and skull all
00:28:02.760 together and now removed from his body
00:28:05.559 it is all but dead it looks like a large
00:28:08.720 polished Crystal lat's Metts tell us
00:28:12.120 lucat had reached a near inorganic State
00:28:15.720 lucat leads the Mind directly to
00:28:18.240 chrstian magical and mysterious beings
00:28:21.039 with almost inorganic bodies perhaps not
00:28:24.240 entirely but they wear red to boost this
00:28:26.880 as much as they can the Christians are
00:28:29.559 shades of blue the inscrutable
00:28:32.519 Christians have their own Culture
00:28:34.880 Creator and clearly a deep
00:28:38.240 intelligence the mind is the seat of
00:28:40.640 thought and therefore of character
00:28:43.279 instincts are one thing but when someone
00:28:45.279 tries to self-control and choose their
00:28:47.679 actions we say it is their true selves
00:28:50.760 we may say it is their soul the mind is
00:28:53.840 therefore linked to Spirit your true
00:28:56.799 self is your soul
00:28:58.880 the soul can have different Natures
00:29:00.600 itself but blue is intimately linked
00:29:02.960 with the soul indeed the blue Primal
00:29:05.240 glint Stone of sellon states that this
00:29:07.399 is in essence her soul ranii died in
00:29:11.000 body alone and her soul lives on torrent
00:29:14.679 is a spirit Steed and as we summon him
00:29:17.960 he appears in
00:29:20.080 blue if red was wild heat and energy
00:29:23.519 blue is cool and calm and at extremes
00:29:27.640 cold and Ice if red is fire blue is
00:29:31.840 water the Sun to the
00:29:34.320 Moon the cold is intimately connected
00:29:37.080 with blue and there is a pattern here
00:29:38.960 too as the nature becomes more cold the
00:29:42.120 blue becomes paler paler blue brings
00:29:45.240 Frost damage and frost
00:29:47.679 protection coldness and the mind
00:29:50.080 combined gives logic diligent thought
00:29:53.880 free from emotion blue is this cold
00:29:56.600 mental operation instead of needing to
00:29:59.320 be tamed like instinct it is The Taming
00:30:02.480 energy The Guiding reason this form of
00:30:05.640 mind is used by Sorcerers to unlock
00:30:07.679 secrets about the world new spells the
00:30:10.880 understanding of the stars and of
00:30:13.120 themselves it is extremely powerful if
00:30:16.320 limited just as instinct is we see the
00:30:19.480 power of this form of Mind in game R is
00:30:22.559 the epitome of it if we attack her on
00:30:25.159 first meeting what happens no no
00:30:28.279 indignation no damage to Pride what
00:30:31.440 hopest thou to
00:30:33.640 profit H she doesn't even physically
00:30:37.200 respond there is no logical reason to
00:30:40.360 nothing to gain by it she dissolves this
00:30:43.440 temporary spiritual body into the air in
00:30:46.360 a shimmer of
00:30:48.399 blue even if we tried to kill her after
00:30:51.240 being her loyal Ally after placing an
00:30:54.120 engagement ring on her finger and
00:30:56.159 swearing to become her consort how does
00:30:58.559 she respond no Rage or aggression what
00:31:02.960 hopest thou to
00:31:05.600 [Music]
00:31:06.880 profit she asks us why we would do this
00:31:10.279 a logical question then reflects on her
00:31:12.960 behavior and how she may have caused her
00:31:15.159 own
00:31:16.600 downfall so this is the measure of my
00:31:19.760 Lord Perhaps it is precisely what I
00:31:22.880 deserve for surrendering myself to
00:31:26.519 delusion the blo of these cold logical
00:31:29.600 forms of mind and Ronnie's Behavior may
00:31:32.080 lead us to believe there are no blue
00:31:34.039 emotions but this is not true they exist
00:31:37.440 they are just drastically different to
00:31:39.279 red ones what emotions might blue feel
00:31:43.159 what emotions come with coldness with
00:31:46.200 logic Ronnie tells us when talking about
00:31:49.200 her planned form of order she will take
00:31:52.159 us into fear doubt and loneliness
00:31:58.039 blue emotions include all of these a
00:32:00.880 rational mind that analyzes and looks at
00:32:03.600 evidence will always carry doubt the
00:32:06.200 world is full of the unknown of chaos
00:32:08.880 and Randomness a blue mind will think
00:32:11.440 about the limitations of knowledge how
00:32:13.600 knowledge can be an illusion even Gideon
00:32:16.360 The all- Knowing has gaps in knowledge
00:32:18.559 and makes mistakes a blue mind doubts
00:32:22.639 fear comes next and directly from doubt
00:32:26.279 it is a fear of the Unown known not the
00:32:29.000 known the fearless are usually those who
00:32:31.679 don't know enough the red and foolishly
00:32:35.120 confident loneliness for a cold rational
00:32:38.279 mind is almost a guarantee less animal
00:32:42.159 less instinctive less social more
00:32:46.039 introspective wanting to understand more
00:32:48.760 than feel loneliness is a complete match
00:32:52.240 with blue the Mind struggles to connect
00:32:54.639 with others as easily as the body can
00:32:57.200 and mental Pursuits have their costs
00:33:00.559 many of the sorcerers we find in game
00:33:02.760 have receded into thoughts so deeply
00:33:05.039 they have stopped being social entirely
00:33:07.679 they do not even talk to us disconnected
00:33:11.360 Sorcerers are spread out across the
00:33:13.279 world and are quite content in their
00:33:16.480 Solitude other blue emotions are more
00:33:19.279 positive calmness ease in one's own
00:33:22.519 company pleasure in learning and
00:33:25.399 erudition self-awareness
00:33:28.399 it may not sound exciting but it can do
00:33:30.760 very well which is why blue has a
00:33:33.200 Premier Place in
00:33:36.279 society blue is the color of the
00:33:38.639 effective members of developed Society
00:33:41.519 beastial Constitution informs us of
00:33:44.039 society's shift to Blue having gained
00:33:46.679 intelligence the beasts must have felt
00:33:48.799 how their wildness slipped away as
00:33:50.639 civilization took hold it is not chaotic
00:33:54.080 like the red of the animal it does what
00:33:56.360 should be done it self-controls for
00:33:59.080 Success blue is ever present in the
00:34:01.679 clothes of those in society to display
00:34:04.039 this commitment to self-control for the
00:34:06.120 greater good what does Godfrey the Lord
00:34:09.119 wear not horu blue not only Godfrey
00:34:14.199 Lords and Royals of all kinds all wear
00:34:17.199 blue royalty following the guidance of
00:34:19.960 Grace serving the greater good on
00:34:22.079 missions away from the capital where a
00:34:24.440 Navy Hood unlike the Exile red Ood
00:34:28.199 marking them as social outcasts Royals
00:34:31.359 display their respect of society and
00:34:33.639 their adaptation to it official's attire
00:34:36.480 is blue worn by magisterial officers to
00:34:39.280 carry out Grim but necessary tasks that
00:34:42.119 drive the wheels of mankind Devotion to
00:34:45.440 society is what is on display with these
00:34:48.000 robes Blue's true nature once again
00:34:51.079 extends to other cultures ruler's robe
00:34:53.679 States luxurious robe worn by Lords in a
00:34:56.599 smaller Nation its fine blue mantle
00:34:59.359 serves to prove its wearer's status blue
00:35:02.720 proves status in society even the mwin
00:35:06.480 Nobles despite blood being the
00:35:08.680 foundation of their Dynasty wear
00:35:12.359 blue red would only prove one's strength
00:35:15.480 and dominance in animalistic hierarchies
00:35:18.480 societal status is gained another way
00:35:21.079 with a blue mind and blue
00:35:23.760 approach returning to Godfrey and his
00:35:26.320 blue attire we will find perhaps the
00:35:28.560 most beautiful illustration in Game of
00:35:31.240 the natures of color and how they can
00:35:33.440 unlock the rules of this world while
00:35:36.400 Godfrey still controls his beastial
00:35:38.400 nature contained in sarash a regal blue
00:35:41.640 is on display he wields his axe symbolic
00:35:45.240 of his vow to conduct himself as a lord
00:35:48.240 he is very calm he treats us with
00:35:50.800 courtesy when we meet him he remarks how
00:35:53.640 strong we must be to make it this far he
00:35:56.520 peacefully says goodbye to the corpse of
00:35:58.839 his own son the son we killed and does
00:36:02.280 not insult us only sash Roars Godfrey is
00:36:06.480 angry but self-control keeps it within
00:36:10.800 sash finally his self-control gives way
00:36:14.680 and hu emerges he rips open sash
00:36:18.599 releasing the deep red blood which
00:36:21.000 spills all over him making himself his
00:36:23.760 true nature predominantly red the Regal
00:36:27.760 blue attire now hangs shredded drenched
00:36:30.680 in red blood irrelevant forgotten he
00:36:35.079 then says I've given thee courtesy
00:36:40.319 enough courtesy the blue of the Lord is
00:36:44.119 done with with that he
00:36:49.850 [Applause]
00:36:53.119 Roars all these socially productive
00:36:55.640 behaviors help to keep out one very
00:36:58.359 dangerous thing which leads us to
00:37:03.200 Yellow perhaps the most notorious color
00:37:06.240 in the world of Elden ring the color of
00:37:09.480 chaos yellow is the end of form or order
00:37:13.040 of any kind beyond the animal wildness
00:37:15.680 of red Beyond even extreme motion or
00:37:18.560 manic thought it is pure
00:37:21.760 chaos no Society can endure no emotion
00:37:25.319 sustain no being survive
00:37:28.280 all of these things are patterns which
00:37:30.880 cannot exist in chaos the Mind cannot
00:37:34.319 witness chaos without Madness the eye
00:37:37.119 cannot even process it without
00:37:39.480 destruction chaos like all fundamental
00:37:42.480 aspects of nature in the Elden ring
00:37:44.440 universe is paired with a color yellow
00:37:49.200 the frenzy flame does not only look
00:37:51.079 yellow it is explicitly called yellow
00:37:53.440 again and again in spell descriptions in
00:37:56.200 fact all but one of the frenzy spells
00:37:58.200 mention the specific quality of yellow
00:38:00.520 and the one exception doesn't even
00:38:02.040 summon the flame as well as yellowness
00:38:04.680 being explicit to its nature so is chaos
00:38:08.440 the lord of the flame of frenzy is
00:38:10.560 called the Lord of chaos chaos and
00:38:13.800 yellow pair up throughout the game
00:38:16.160 things that possess aspects of chaos
00:38:18.280 take the color yellow with only certain
00:38:20.599 things going a deep yellow the pattern
00:38:23.079 is very consistent from yellow boluses
00:38:26.280 eye of yellow grown in frenzy Afflicted
00:38:28.319 lands to the frenzy flame Stone which
00:38:30.960 swaps yellow in place of the gold of its
00:38:33.520 gentler cousin even our eyes when we
00:38:36.280 have accepted the flame turn a vivid
00:38:38.280 yellow reflecting the chaos within us
00:38:40.839 the chaos which will eventually consume
00:38:43.760 us so what is chaos in typical language
00:38:48.280 it is complete disorder and confusion in
00:38:51.800 science it is more about total
00:38:54.720 unpredictability disorder of course
00:38:56.960 contrasts TRS with order it is therefore
00:38:59.319 a fundamental aspect of the world it may
00:39:02.119 be a lie but shabiri says shabiri is
00:39:06.280 chaos
00:39:08.359 incarnate I
00:39:11.079 cannot
00:39:14.960 die whether or not shabiri can be
00:39:17.599 destroyed chaos certainly cannot
00:39:21.920 be it is the bottom on a scale of order
00:39:25.200 or a peak on the scale of Chaos
00:39:27.920 order is structure patterns divisions
00:39:31.280 chaos is its opposite it cannot be
00:39:33.760 destroyed any more than you can
00:39:35.440 permanently destroy a temperature
00:39:38.079 however this does not mean that chaos
00:39:39.920 doesn't have a very real effect on
00:39:41.920 anything non-chaotic shabiri wishes for
00:39:44.839 the yellow flame to incinerate all that
00:39:48.960 divides and
00:39:51.280 distinguishes yellow is disordered but
00:39:53.839 yellow has an effect on other things too
00:39:56.560 like acid ch es what it comes into
00:39:58.720 contact with it brings things to chaos
00:40:01.760 it burns up order Caray's cut dialogue
00:40:05.839 states that a frenzied flame can melt
00:40:08.319 away the curses suffering and despair
00:40:12.000 and the order
00:40:14.240 entire the reverse is true order is
00:40:17.640 destructive to chaos look at how the
00:40:20.319 nomads are locked away sealed and
00:40:22.839 rejected by order look how thick heavy
00:40:26.400 doors are simple physical order seal the
00:40:29.520 three fingers look how the flame of
00:40:31.720 frenzy decays to Red once we cast in a
00:40:35.280 domain of non-chaos it becomes its red
00:40:38.240 less chaotic neighbor before fading away
00:40:41.800 neither order or chaos can survive in an
00:40:44.200 environment which is overwhelmingly the
00:40:46.480 opposite shabiri has been working on his
00:40:49.079 plan for a long long
00:40:51.319 time
00:40:55.920 make the world
00:40:59.000 but until our influence the frenzy flame
00:41:01.480 is still so irrelevant it can be totally
00:41:03.839 missed in a playthrough it is not much
00:41:06.119 easier being an anarchist than someone
00:41:08.319 trying to progress order in society to
00:41:10.880 move the scale long term is an enormous
00:41:13.400 challenge hard to believe imagine adding
00:41:16.359 as much chaos as you could to the world
00:41:19.160 how long would one last before being
00:41:20.960 locked up or saying farewell to the
00:41:23.160 world
00:41:24.240 oneself the damage chaos does to the
00:41:26.599 order that accepts it is obvious our
00:41:29.359 yellow eyes will eventually become
00:41:31.280 yellow Embers burst and broken from
00:41:34.079 Suffering The Flame of chaos simply
00:41:36.440 seeing the dazzling glare of frenzy for
00:41:38.720 too long is too much for the order of
00:41:40.839 our eyes the merchant suffer the three
00:41:44.839 fingers seems injured or heavily
00:41:47.319 fatigued but it may not be from outside
00:41:50.160 influences it is just the cost of
00:41:52.359 holding chaos within
00:41:54.119 it finally it burns up
00:41:59.319 even channeling chaos is not free it
00:42:01.880 means damage to anything with order we
00:42:04.800 ourselves are a lot of order and the
00:42:07.040 pain we feel casting a frenzy spell is
00:42:09.440 obvious even just the sight of the flame
00:42:11.920 of frenzy drives the enemy and ourselves
00:42:15.040 mad all this summoning time and Agony
00:42:18.160 merely to summon frenzy in the most
00:42:20.520 random and inaccurate way frenzy burst
00:42:23.839 is one exception this spell manages to
00:42:26.599 direct chaos in a generally straight
00:42:29.119 Direction yet the frenzy flame shows its
00:42:31.520 nature as it flies wildly spiraling as
00:42:34.319 it Rebels against this control the
00:42:36.720 Spell's description matches our
00:42:38.720 understanding of frenzy in times past
00:42:41.559 every single person who attempted to
00:42:43.480 control the flame of frenzy succumb to
00:42:45.559 Madness after a desperate internal
00:42:47.920 struggle this incantation is Testament
00:42:50.720 to a Meer
00:42:52.119 Victory what else is yellow in game and
00:42:54.680 does it fit with the fundamental nature
00:42:56.720 of chaos there is one thing we can
00:42:58.920 encounter at random in the ples as we
00:43:01.400 ride lightning Randomness is a clue just
00:43:05.680 like the flame of frenzy it bursts forth
00:43:08.319 chaotically and seemingly unpredictably
00:43:11.480 the match between yellow and lightning
00:43:13.079 is more than just the color of lightning
00:43:15.280 if we pickle liver in a yellow medicinal
00:43:17.440 solution it boosts lightning damage
00:43:19.880 negation fer Bloom itself is yellow
00:43:23.480 lightning grease is a bright yellow so
00:43:26.280 lightning has a yellow nature a chaotic
00:43:29.240 sudden unpredictable nature of course
00:43:32.880 lightning isn't always yellow which may
00:43:35.440 hint to how exactly lightning works and
00:43:38.160 what brings it into
00:43:40.079 existence if they exist yellow emotions
00:43:43.119 would be quite a thing to feel what do
00:43:45.839 we feel when our inner order is troubled
00:43:48.160 by yellow pure yellow is beyond emotion
00:43:51.400 but we can be riddled with chaos before
00:43:53.440 we disappear and so too can emotions the
00:43:56.760 simp emotions are the unavoidable ones
00:43:59.599 ravaged by internal chaos one emotion is
00:44:02.680 inevitable fatigue have you noticed that
00:44:05.920 all the nomadic Merchants are seated
00:44:08.640 when Caray or an aggressed Merchant does
00:44:10.839 stand they have very hunched shoulders
00:44:14.240 they slouch even more than the use of
00:44:16.359 their cane requires as skinny as his
00:44:19.400 donkey Caray helps to hold up his own
00:44:21.839 coat with one arm the posture is of
00:44:24.400 someone suffering from fatigue
00:44:26.520 reminiscent of a teenager villagers of
00:44:29.160 the frenzy Village are brought to their
00:44:30.880 knees by the frenzy the three fingers is
00:44:33.920 too alien to be certain but it seems to
00:44:36.359 be exhausted in comparison even the old
00:44:40.000 two fingers described repeatedly as
00:44:42.319 having lost all Vigor stands upright and
00:44:45.240 present until
00:44:46.920 death posture is very carefully designed
00:44:49.920 in Elden Ray Rya is snake likee patches
00:44:53.319 squats those who are learning discipline
00:44:55.880 or lack discipline sit slouching or lie
00:44:58.920 down milicent lies down when suffering
00:45:01.440 from rot then stands tall and elegant as
00:45:04.440 a sword master once revived physical
00:45:07.400 posture is chosen with care and the
00:45:09.160 merchants have been given this gate by
00:45:11.119 design it is not only when using their
00:45:13.480 canes but also when they sit that they
00:45:15.720 hunch over others such as Bernal sit
00:45:18.800 straight upright despite a ton of steel
00:45:21.559 armor haetta as blind as the merchants
00:45:24.880 Stands Tall when she is not yet taken
00:45:27.240 the flame of frenzy within
00:45:30.040 her fatigue will be felt by those who
00:45:32.839 Harbor yellow even if it itself is not
00:45:35.839 directly yellow fatigue correlates
00:45:38.640 heavily with one thing that is certainly
00:45:40.800 yellow creativity thops despite being
00:45:44.520 ill disciplined at school a blunt Stone
00:45:47.079 who can't sit upright create something
00:45:49.400 worthy of a new conspectus millant and
00:45:52.680 others who are weakened and exhausted by
00:45:54.720 rot yet have a creative fire with within
00:45:57.280 them it exhausts them as it burns them
00:45:59.640 up yet it is a great driving force Rod r
00:46:03.200 has a remarkable gift the merchants are
00:46:06.000 enterprising musically talented devise
00:46:08.920 solutions to blindness and have a
00:46:11.119 remarkable fashion sense yellow is
00:46:13.960 creative because it doesn't respect any
00:46:16.359 borders it doesn't have any filters or
00:46:19.160 rules it is
00:46:22.599 unpredictable could the world survive
00:46:24.760 without some chaos could a land between
00:46:27.400 flourish if only two fingers had their
00:46:30.000 way or would no chaos be as destructive
00:46:33.440 as no
00:46:34.800 order all creativity must have some
00:46:37.680 yellow in it but pure yellow is Extreme
00:46:40.880 creativity dellink from order the Mind
00:46:43.599 whirls about manically it might discover
00:46:46.319 anything but this yellow creativity is
00:46:49.079 once again so manic it is damaging to
00:46:51.400 the mind no sooner is an idea had before
00:46:54.359 another crowds it out creat ity beyond
00:46:58.000 all function beyond all capture all
00:47:01.040 memory all use a living torment of
00:47:05.480 possibilities but great creativity
00:47:07.800 usually doesn't come without some
00:47:09.480 Madness the thumb is a fitting example
00:47:12.559 it is the most important and creative
00:47:15.119 part of the hand but it is creative
00:47:17.599 because it is so much more
00:47:23.760 unhinged shabiri gives us the next
00:47:26.240 emotion and incinerate all that divides
00:47:31.319 and
00:47:32.280 distinguishes the yellow emotion of
00:47:35.440 rebellion yellow doesn't want to be
00:47:37.920 controlled yellow doesn't want to follow
00:47:40.599 rules red might be willful but yellow
00:47:43.599 will Rebel even if it is against its own
00:47:46.119 interests to do so Rebellion is innate
00:47:49.400 to it it will not be contained shabiri
00:47:53.200 himself is reviled yet he does not let
00:47:55.599 the opinions of others constrain his
00:47:57.960 behavior how are the yellow materials
00:48:00.240 that make lightning described
00:48:02.760 fulminating what a profoundly odd and
00:48:05.880 specific word for a Japanese game
00:48:08.559 fulminating can mean to explode
00:48:10.960 violently or Flash like lightning but
00:48:13.880 this is a literary definition its
00:48:16.119 primary definition means to express
00:48:18.520 vement protest yellow is a constant
00:48:21.920 Revolution against order shabui laughs
00:48:25.079 at our judgment nomadic Merchants were
00:48:27.359 cast out for heretical beliefs only for
00:48:29.920 them to summon the flame of frenzy to
00:48:32.440 this day they live outside of society
00:48:35.119 Nomads who live under their own rules
00:48:38.400 lightning itself is willful and hard to
00:48:41.000 direct even the masters of lightning
00:48:43.119 receive heavy lightning damage perhaps
00:48:45.839 they are only channelers of it and not
00:48:49.319 rulers how does the flame of frenzy
00:48:51.599 itself behave when we try to channel it
00:48:54.319 it wries furiously against Direction
00:48:57.640 the sheer time to summon it is something
00:48:59.640 any frenzy flame spellcaster has
00:49:01.680 suffered a further example of the
00:49:04.040 rebellious nature of frenzy is
00:49:06.599 counterintuitively the spell GM's Fury
00:49:09.920 it looks uncannily like the behavior of
00:49:12.799 the flame of frenzy why because both are
00:49:16.760 physically rebelling neither want to be
00:49:19.280 summoned gma's Fury is held to represent
00:49:22.720 the fury of the volcano Gare itself
00:49:26.240 however the the arrogance of attempting
00:49:27.880 to harness it is solely that of men and
00:49:31.040 serpents it is not the place of men and
00:49:33.319 serpents to try and tame a volcano so
00:49:36.319 the magma bursts chaotically from the
00:49:38.520 ground rebellious frenzy
00:49:42.480 like the most heavily referenced yellow
00:49:45.079 emotion is madness this may be more what
00:49:48.240 happens with chaotic thoughts and
00:49:50.200 emotions a lack of inner order so
00:49:52.640 extreme your mind breaks down if all
00:49:55.480 thoughts and emotions can never rest or
00:49:57.599 settle they cannot be put into action or
00:50:00.319 even remembered effectively how can one
00:50:03.319 sleep with a chaotic mind how can one
00:50:05.880 resist the tides of euphoria paranoia
00:50:09.599 hysteria so intense it corrodes our mind
00:50:12.720 to
00:50:14.280 Madness a final relatable emotion is the
00:50:17.319 Glee taken in chaos a desire and joy for
00:50:21.520 surprise mess
00:50:24.319 unpredictability oh make chaos take the
00:50:28.920 world may chaos take the
00:50:33.680 world many experience a love of chaos
00:50:36.200 while young if you can feel what we're
00:50:38.280 talking about you might have some frenzy
00:50:40.359 in you just like in a chaos taken too
00:50:43.599 far can drive you mad outer chaos taken
00:50:46.440 too far leads inevitably to
00:50:48.960 self-destruction and yet there is
00:50:51.319 nothing else like
00:50:54.799 it what about yellow's place in society
00:50:58.359 practically speaking it has none aside
00:51:01.040 from the odd flash of creativity that
00:51:03.119 might be viewed as acceptable yellow
00:51:05.240 isn't welcome even then Society doesn't
00:51:08.359 want creatives coming and disrupting the
00:51:10.680 hierarchy Rebellion doesn't work well in
00:51:13.119 society rules must be followed not only
00:51:16.359 at the large scale law religion or
00:51:19.079 Customs but at the smaller social scale
00:51:22.400 Nomads are solitary when they aren't
00:51:24.079 rounded up and locked away yellow is is
00:51:26.640 n't good at Social niceties and rules of
00:51:28.799 courtesy Caray himself says I've always
00:51:32.200 preferred my own company to that of
00:51:35.000 other people's on top of that Caray
00:51:37.920 doesn't hold back the truth ah then you
00:51:41.720 made blly did you wonderful I'm glad I
00:51:45.640 pointed you in his Direction he's borish
00:51:49.599 blunt and couldn't find his nose with
00:51:52.319 both hands but he's a good egg
00:51:56.640 I think the two of you are sure to find
00:51:58.359 the best in one another calling blly The
00:52:01.400 Good Egg doesn't undo the insult but
00:52:04.040 yellow doesn't play the courtesy game
00:52:06.720 the kit costs a bundle and I admit I do
00:52:09.559 take my cut but the important thing is
00:52:12.559 that you
00:52:14.040 survive every customer counts after all
00:52:18.680 unfiltered honest but not tactful at
00:52:22.559 large scales not only the social but the
00:52:25.160 individual and whol Society are
00:52:27.359 destroyed in chaos the ending in
00:52:30.240 typically obscure fashion shows this the
00:52:33.079 Lord of frenzy ending is the only one
00:52:35.160 without any context there is no dialogue
00:52:39.200 no description of the age no story of
00:52:42.280 how it will be
00:52:43.640 remembered everything has been
00:52:46.280 destroyed finally chaos is linked to
00:52:49.920 time predictability chaos order without
00:52:54.599 time do these make sense
00:52:57.000 order is in some sense predictable or
00:53:00.000 patterned over time and Chaos has no
00:53:03.760 predictability at any time yet chaos
00:53:07.160 cannot die therefore chaos is Immortal
00:53:11.240 it lives forever yet has no duration to
00:53:14.480 its existence moment to moment how
00:53:18.240 peculiar how peculiar too that on
00:53:20.960 becoming mad or within a great frenzied
00:53:23.799 spell or the great frenzied son
00:53:27.200 and ourselves as the Lord of chaos have
00:53:30.119 a core of
00:53:34.360 [Music]
00:53:36.160 black black is a remarkable color in
00:53:38.680 Elden ring and we believe that it is
00:53:41.160 paired with time time is referenced
00:53:44.799 heavily in game a God is supposed to
00:53:47.440 live a life eternal the dragon lord
00:53:50.160 lives beyond time we can stop the
00:53:52.599 meddling of an outer God but only when
00:53:54.920 Beyond Time ancient dragon smithing
00:53:57.680 Stones lightly twist time which allow
00:54:00.240 the creation of a weapon capable of
00:54:02.559 slaying a god time is an essential
00:54:05.599 aspect of everything and it is very
00:54:07.839 linked to Gods Life Death entropy and
00:54:12.000 much more time after all dictates the
00:54:14.920 duration of your existence however time
00:54:17.839 is not directly part of existence in the
00:54:20.160 same way red or blue is in a similar way
00:54:23.319 it might be said that black is not truly
00:54:25.559 a color instead there is a scale on
00:54:28.000 which black and white are the extremes
00:54:30.760 Darkness to lightness and all colors can
00:54:33.559 be shifted along this scale to clarify
00:54:36.760 this it is easiest to look at one end of
00:54:39.000 that
00:54:40.319 scale what is black black is one extreme
00:54:44.559 End of Time rates time
00:54:48.839 stopping when something stops
00:54:50.799 progressing in time it turns black an
00:54:53.880 obvious and simple example is death
00:54:56.960 the lands between us
00:54:59.640 shrouded by death's dark
00:55:03.520 fate fate becoming dark is a fate that
00:55:06.839 stops one form of death though there are
00:55:09.760 many forms is if a being stops
00:55:12.040 continuing in time black is death
00:55:16.599 lightning death
00:55:18.960 blight part of the god slaying black
00:55:21.960 Flame the Forbidden Shadow plucked from
00:55:25.240 the golden order upon its
00:55:28.079 creation and the black that ends
00:55:30.400 radigan's life
00:55:32.119 eternal the boluses we consume to robust
00:55:35.000 ourselves against death blight are black
00:55:38.079 time is so essential to death that to
00:55:40.640 those Beyond Time death may not apply
00:55:44.520 black may help boost the effectiveness
00:55:46.520 of killing in and of itself the Night
00:55:49.119 Riders are dressed all in black and
00:55:51.119 their weapons are jet black they were
00:55:53.680 deliverers of death for great warriors
00:55:55.760 Knights and champions the black could be
00:55:58.400 more than symbolic given their aim of
00:56:01.240 note here are the ever jails and orda
00:56:03.839 the lurgical town for both of these we
00:56:06.359 can enter another realm and we find the
00:56:08.520 world Beyond shrouded in darkness yet
00:56:11.799 this does not seem to be a new place at
00:56:14.200 least not entirely after all the runes
00:56:16.920 we drop on death are findable in our
00:56:19.160 reality so are ever jails in fact the
00:56:22.480 ultimate prison a jail that holds its
00:56:25.079 prisoners by freezing time they are
00:56:27.760 called ever jails after
00:56:30.319 all there are more complicated aspects
00:56:33.119 of time stopping for which Miyazaki
00:56:35.440 seems to have been partly inspired by
00:56:37.319 scientific theories about the universe
00:56:39.960 time or any meaning of time stops at the
00:56:43.000 center of chaos what do we see at the
00:56:45.839 center of the flame of frenzy when it is
00:56:48.119 intense enough a black core as we have
00:56:51.720 mentioned chaos is eternal but has no
00:56:54.200 duration therefore paradoxic basically
00:56:56.880 its time state does not progress another
00:57:00.079 place where time slows and eventually
00:57:01.920 stops is areas of deep gravity and black
00:57:05.200 is exactly what we see in the center of
00:57:07.480 powerful gravity
00:57:12.160 spells the other end of the scale is
00:57:15.000 white all colors can lighten by adding
00:57:17.720 white but what is full white where black
00:57:20.920 is the current of time completely
00:57:22.640 stopping white is deep time duration and
00:57:26.280 maximum time duration is infinite so too
00:57:30.280 deep a color and it ceases to move in
00:57:32.680 time too diluted and pale it lasts and
00:57:36.240 lasts but what is the only thing that
00:57:38.599 truly lasts forever nothingness the
00:57:42.039 permanent background in which all things
00:57:44.280 come and go so depth of color is more
00:57:47.559 intense in its existence but has less
00:57:49.680 duration and as Things become whiter
00:57:52.160 they last longer but are less intense
00:57:54.799 this scale is actually therefore simply
00:57:57.280 an aspect of all colors the world of
00:58:00.280 Elden ring confirms this whiteness
00:58:03.039 increases time duration but at a cost
00:58:06.160 all items we make with white meat say
00:58:08.480 this clearly lasts longer than
00:58:10.760 traditional cured meat but with reduced
00:58:13.559 Effectiveness aloric show this too
00:58:17.079 however color is not surface deep so we
00:58:19.480 have to be careful as we move to more
00:58:21.359 complicated things in the world such as
00:58:23.359 creatures everything inside and out has
00:58:25.839 a color and an influence something may
00:58:28.880 be as much skin as clothing and we only
00:58:31.520 discover the color of blood in battle
00:58:34.520 luckily Alban orics do not only have
00:58:36.680 white skin but also white blood what is
00:58:40.319 their nature as we expect for something
00:58:42.839 so pale to the core they are extremely
00:58:45.520 weak their bows are specifically
00:58:47.680 designed to require dexterity over
00:58:49.920 strength to master they need wolves to
00:58:52.599 help them move in battle when we summon
00:58:55.119 latena she has exceptionally low health
00:58:57.440 for a summon only young albor manage
00:59:00.680 carrying the shield of their namesake
00:59:03.119 yet for all this weakness whiteness
00:59:05.520 makes them last and
00:59:07.280 last as deep time goes by Alban orics
00:59:10.559 wash out their color and become nothing
00:59:13.480 my legs will soon fade and with them my
00:59:17.799 life fade so what is Health in terms of
00:59:22.200 time duration not gray which is time
00:59:25.400 itself disordered and messy Health
00:59:28.079 cannot function without good timekeeping
00:59:30.799 not black which is stalling the stream
00:59:33.280 clogging it unhealthily like a sludge
00:59:36.280 nor too pale which is like butter spread
00:59:38.599 over too much bread health is surely
00:59:41.440 somewhere in between this is what those
00:59:43.680 in the know wish for healthy color and
00:59:46.599 to some it was gifted long ago the grace
00:59:49.799 of gold blessed those who were first to
00:59:51.720 serve it with the most Vivid coloration
00:59:54.880 to be healthy whatever your mix is of
00:59:57.200 color is to be
00:59:59.799 Vivid just as all the ranges of the
01:00:02.079 scale have an impact the two extrems
01:00:04.799 black and white have an important
01:00:07.000 relation what has ceased to exist and
01:00:10.200 what lasts and lasts is the eye the
01:00:13.440 window to the soul and mind
01:00:15.520 representative of the departure of
01:00:17.400 intelligence in later generation albor
01:00:20.319 but the whiteness of their longevity is
01:00:22.359 still shown in the
01:00:23.880 body the two extremes of the scale are
01:00:26.480 very useful individually but they are
01:00:28.839 also useful together you can kill with
01:00:31.280 white too just as with black and the mix
01:00:34.400 of stopping something with black and
01:00:36.359 then making that moment last forever
01:00:38.559 with white is deadly or making an aspect
01:00:42.359 of something sustain indefinitely which
01:00:44.640 will eventually kill works too stopping
01:00:47.760 Scarlet rot is simply halting its
01:00:49.799 progression in time but if time is
01:00:52.119 reconed it means death dark emot ions
01:00:56.400 are intense and consuming but they move
01:00:58.920 on fast like Childs paler emotions are
01:01:02.359 calmer but last longer in raw nature
01:01:06.200 white emotions might be long-term
01:01:08.200 gratitude or regret while black is more
01:01:11.280 likely to be brief but consuming anger
01:01:13.880 or Elation but any emotion can be light
01:01:16.960 or dark it is defined by intensity and
01:01:20.280 duration what we can be sure about is
01:01:22.720 that emotions which are inextricably
01:01:24.720 linked with eternity will be black or
01:01:27.599 white despair according to Eternal
01:01:30.720 Darkness has a core of black despair is
01:01:34.280 the complete loss or absence of hope you
01:01:37.760 know what you hope for can never come to
01:01:39.960 pass and never is black in its time
01:01:43.119 state is there an emotion that is the
01:01:45.599 opposite that matches something existing
01:01:48.720 eternally perhaps if Hope Springs
01:01:51.440 Eternal it is itself White
01:01:57.590 [Music]
01:02:02.640 purple purple has always been a
01:02:05.440 remarkable color in our world extremely
01:02:08.400 hard to find in nature it was a rare
01:02:10.559 site before the modern day thanks to
01:02:13.480 this unique obscurity it has been
01:02:15.599 consistently associated with similar
01:02:17.680 ideas across cultures from east to west
01:02:20.960 wealth is a frequent one anything hard
01:02:23.319 to obtain will have this connotation
01:02:25.920 more interestingly there are the
01:02:27.400 associations of spirituality the
01:02:29.920 subconscious and Imagination in general
01:02:33.319 of the border between worlds this is one
01:02:36.960 case where evidence in game seems to
01:02:39.240 match with our real world Notions
01:02:41.520 something not always the case the color
01:02:44.680 of sleep in game is purple we know this
01:02:48.039 from numerous items of St
01:02:52.359 Trina to perhaps even the first meeting
01:02:55.279 with Rani
01:02:57.119 what happens when we sleep in our world
01:02:59.359 it feels like we leave our bodies or at
01:03:02.160 the very least the time vanishes it is
01:03:04.880 certainly a place where the subconscious
01:03:06.880 continues to live and while opinions
01:03:09.000 vary no one can deny that there is
01:03:10.920 something magical about dreams in Elden
01:03:14.319 ring dreams achieve great things sustain
01:03:17.440 generations of warriors in their jars
01:03:20.200 may even be that which motivates a
01:03:22.200 tarnished yet in Elden ring the sense of
01:03:24.839 Dreams being truly another world is very
01:03:28.359 real I dreamt for so
01:03:31.240 long sleep is the gateway to dreams and
01:03:34.119 the realm of Dreams is a real place some
01:03:37.039 may seem to be sleeping but be quite
01:03:39.160 busy in this dream world we ourselves
01:03:42.079 enter fear's dream as she sleeps we
01:03:44.839 fight forter saxs in her deathbed dream
01:03:48.000 the surface of the boss fight a quagmire
01:03:50.400 of purple perhaps she uses a sleep pot
01:03:53.480 to put herself to sleep and yet the
01:03:56.400 events of this shared dream have
01:03:58.119 enormous realworld
01:04:00.520 consequences Trina's torch burns with a
01:04:03.200 purple flame and these purple Flames
01:04:05.720 cause sleep but Trina is involved in
01:04:08.240 more than just sleep Trina is clearly
01:04:11.039 depicted with a third eye in the center
01:04:13.200 of the forehead the third eye is to see
01:04:16.279 beyond to see across boundaries into
01:04:19.640 other worlds sleep is simply one of
01:04:22.880 these many borders between worlds Trina
01:04:25.880 may be a saint of journeying into the
01:04:28.279 subconscious the dream world the
01:04:30.680 spiritual world the energy to bridge
01:04:33.359 these gaps is
01:04:35.680 purple what is the energy that brings
01:04:38.079 more classical physical worlds together
01:04:40.799 the force that defines the border of a
01:04:42.720 world star or Galaxy gravity that which
01:04:47.240 makes physical bodies move almost with a
01:04:49.440 mind of their own indeed when one thinks
01:04:52.359 that interfering with it causes small
01:04:54.160 lightning Sparks it may that the matter
01:04:56.480 Rebels at our medling gravity is much
01:04:59.599 stronger and much more relevant to
01:05:01.559 physical bodies and so gravity is a deep
01:05:04.640 purple in Elden ring how do we bring
01:05:07.319 meteorites into a battle with gravity
01:05:10.480 preferably with glint stones that boost
01:05:12.640 gravity sorceries which are of course
01:05:15.480 purple gravity and Elden ring pulls but
01:05:18.359 not merely from distances but pierces to
01:05:21.440 completely different regions we don't
01:05:23.920 have to wait for the meteorites to come
01:05:25.720 come from space gravity can open a door
01:05:28.520 or bridge between worlds as sleep does
01:05:31.160 bringing collapsing stars or meteorites
01:05:33.799 from nothing and even pulling objects
01:05:35.960 from the mysterious void astel the
01:05:39.079 leveler of the Eternal City is very
01:05:41.240 talented at moving through gravity
01:05:44.160 doorways but the master of moving
01:05:46.680 Between Worlds is the Elden Beast what
01:05:49.880 color does the Elden Beast emit when
01:05:51.880 transporting us to another realm deep
01:05:55.359 ground gravity
01:05:58.160 [Music]
01:06:00.599 purple both gravity and sleep are
01:06:03.200 dragging sinking forces one weighs down
01:06:06.520 focus and presence the other weighs you
01:06:09.000 down physically and exhausts you this
01:06:11.839 shared sinking effect in different
01:06:14.079 intensities and across different PLS are
01:06:16.799 represented by their shades of purple it
01:06:19.839 once again fits the pattern of darkness
01:06:22.160 and lightness of color dark purple is
01:06:25.119 more intense has a stronger physical
01:06:27.720 effect but it doesn't last as long at
01:06:30.480 its most intense it goes black and as in
01:06:33.319 our world time stops indeed with stars
01:06:36.680 seeming to dictate fate this hints at
01:06:39.000 how time fate and gravity are connected
01:06:43.200 meanwhile light purple lasts much longer
01:06:46.000 is gentler doesn't peer so deeply as the
01:06:48.839 physical but nonetheless drags us to the
01:06:51.559 world of
01:06:53.319 Dreams what is the most important
01:06:55.559 animportant border to Being Human
01:06:57.880 whether you're a dreamer or purely
01:06:59.839 practical it is surely the border
01:07:01.960 between the mind and the body red is the
01:07:05.079 body blue is the Mind red and blue gives
01:07:09.720 purple both weaken each other in a way
01:07:12.839 the body exhausting the mind the Mind
01:07:15.279 questioning and tempering the body but
01:07:17.880 it is this costly relationship that
01:07:19.799 gives rise to great things imagination
01:07:23.039 dreams the subconscious the Deep
01:07:25.720 invisible wisdom of the third eye purple
01:07:29.319 is this border neither enough presence
01:07:31.640 to be fully blue yet not all raw
01:07:34.640 instincts and animal unconsciousness to
01:07:36.960 be read this mysterious middle is what
01:07:40.039 makes us human exists too imbalanced in
01:07:43.039 any direction and the humanity Fades
01:07:46.720 away we have mentioned there are many
01:07:49.039 ways to die in Elden ring but total
01:07:51.160 Destruction is quite rare instead
01:07:53.760 destroying an essential border that
01:07:55.559 makes us human is one solution before
01:07:58.279 the Earth tree there was a different
01:07:59.799 system for dealing with the dead they
01:08:01.680 were burnt in ghost flame interestingly
01:08:04.680 we know from the spirits that resulted
01:08:06.520 from this process that it was not a
01:08:08.319 destruction of everything the bodies may
01:08:10.839 have been destroyed raak as ashes but
01:08:13.440 the spirits lived on sometimes with
01:08:15.720 great bitterness but they were no longer
01:08:18.920 human how did they separate these minds
01:08:21.960 or Souls from their bodies with ghost
01:08:25.040 flame
01:08:25.960 ghost flame burnt this border between
01:08:28.120 the two worlds what color is ghost flame
01:08:31.920 despite the appearance of the Magic in
01:08:33.479 the current day its color is violet a
01:08:37.439 purple flower that blooms in graveyards
01:08:40.399 the Hue of ghost flame and we see this
01:08:43.839 purple used by a master the tibia
01:08:46.158 Mariner as he brings back dead from
01:08:48.359 their world he himself fades in and out
01:08:51.279 of this world likely to the world of the
01:08:53.719 Dead wrapped in purple the whole time it
01:08:57.120 is unclear why the current ghost flame
01:08:58.920 magic and its users are a different Hue
01:09:01.319 however is this the remaining color once
01:09:03.759 all this is purple has burnt away the
01:09:06.238 body left as ashes or maybe only in this
01:09:09.439 later order has ghost flame lost its
01:09:13.000 Hue the purple consumables staffs grease
01:09:17.198 plants all patterned to sleep gravity
01:09:20.198 and borders to other worlds purple cured
01:09:23.158 meat called clarifying prevent the
01:09:25.640 buildup of sleep and Madness sleep of
01:09:28.759 course prevents Focus but Madness is
01:09:31.719 interesting because purple is not the
01:09:34.120 opposite of chaos perhaps if the third
01:09:37.238 eye becomes too dominant we begin to see
01:09:40.319 things in the random chants of the world
01:09:43.120 that simply aren't there it is a fine
01:09:46.198 line between intuition and Madness the
01:09:50.080 subconscious and its interpretation
01:09:53.000 dreams and understanding the outside
01:09:56.000 world and its patterns it is so easy to
01:09:59.560 fall into Superstition and fantasy
01:10:02.960 imagination can run wild you might end
01:10:05.960 up believing in what simply doesn't
01:10:10.679 exist and yet the mysteries of purple
01:10:13.960 are so
01:10:16.640 [Music]
01:10:23.239 seductive green is a more abstract color
01:10:25.840 than red or blue but it is essential to
01:10:28.440 both in the lands between in our
01:10:30.719 playthrough green might be seen as less
01:10:32.719 important as it is less relatable than
01:10:35.239 red but it is just as fundamental we
01:10:38.640 meet green time and time again in game
01:10:41.000 when it helps us as stamina and hinders
01:10:43.600 us as poison but it is more complicated
01:10:46.480 than that for stamina there are many
01:10:48.840 items which show the pattern green spill
01:10:51.480 Crystal tiar raises Max stamina its
01:10:54.000 green burst cousin raises stamina
01:10:55.920 recovery and green turtle Talisman does
01:10:58.560 the same a turtle neck pickled in green
01:11:01.600 also boosts stamina recovery a
01:11:03.840 completely different effect to the red
01:11:05.960 unpickled neck from the same creature
01:11:08.920 but what is stamina stamina is defined
01:11:12.080 as the ability to sustain prolonged
01:11:14.800 physical or mental effort but what gives
01:11:18.080 that ability in essence what is physical
01:11:21.360 and mental activity really it seems to
01:11:24.199 be reducible to Motion in the physical
01:11:26.520 world and in the mental the more
01:11:28.719 abstract animation green is therefore
01:11:31.920 the animating energy for the body or
01:11:34.719 mind it is in that which moves animates
01:11:42.400 progresses Cycles Rises grows it is in
01:11:46.840 nature certainly but so too in the
01:11:49.320 racing
01:11:54.080 mind and and the body is full of energy
01:11:57.760 Green in isolation has another clear
01:12:00.280 effect in game a green medicinal
01:12:02.560 solution creates various cured meats
01:12:04.880 that boost immunity immunity helps fight
01:12:08.000 poison we consume it like a small dose
01:12:10.760 of poison to strengthen our resistances
01:12:12.960 for the Future neutralizing boluses made
01:12:15.840 from nothing but cave Moss but this time
01:12:18.360 naturally green also boosts your
01:12:20.440 immunity against poisons poison bone
01:12:23.120 darts and arrows poison your enemy and
01:12:25.520 their tips drip in green liquid the
01:12:28.040 various horn Charms have various effects
01:12:30.520 patterned by their color the one that
01:12:32.639 boosts immunity has green on the horns
01:12:35.679 and of course everything that causes
01:12:37.400 typical poison follows the same pattern
01:12:40.280 the pattern goes on well beyond this but
01:12:42.880 is this the other side of the same coin
01:12:45.639 could animation itself be poison and if
01:12:48.920 so how the first hint to Green's nature
01:12:52.760 is the fact that the green rule for
01:12:54.520 poison not rot which we will come to
01:12:57.320 continues across plants to inanimate
01:12:59.600 stones to Medicine the second is that
01:13:02.880 there is a consistent color difference a
01:13:05.600 consistent shade of green that
01:13:07.000 differentiates stamina or healthy
01:13:09.239 animation with unhealthy animation
01:13:11.880 poison poisons in our world are not a
01:13:14.840 specific shade of green stamina green is
01:13:17.960 consistently a rich Vivid green sitting
01:13:20.960 healthily in the range of the color but
01:13:23.560 poison is a shade of green green that
01:13:25.760 moves towards yellow why is unhealthy
01:13:29.520 animation towards the shade of yellow
01:13:32.760 because it becomes disordered or by
01:13:35.679 another name chaotic better to have
01:13:38.679 ordered motion even if it is a little
01:13:40.880 slower than desired over chaotic
01:13:43.920 motion animation going wrong in the body
01:13:46.800 is very linked to timing going wrong
01:13:49.080 movement being paired with time we know
01:13:51.840 from black and white that gray
01:13:53.320 timekeeping doesn't do well for he
01:13:55.120 Health what about chaotic movement or
01:13:57.800 animation within our bodies what can
01:14:00.679 happen if the body's processes go out of
01:14:03.790 [Music]
01:14:06.520 sink how fast might we last with a sped
01:14:09.320 up heart and a slowed down liver or a
01:14:12.360 metabolism many times too fast chaotic
01:14:15.760 bodily processes are deadly even slight
01:14:18.560 Rhythm errors between them over long
01:14:20.560 periods of time causes huge problems in
01:14:23.080 the organs therefore if the green is not
01:14:25.880 the right shade and it gets in your
01:14:27.639 system it is
01:14:29.400 poison green has simpler emotions than
01:14:32.280 red or blue and while it has its highs
01:14:34.679 and lows its place is the animation of
01:14:37.239 things of emotions and thoughts too the
01:14:40.480 rate of change whether they cycle or not
01:14:43.600 how fast they come and go green also has
01:14:47.159 its own Mysteries is the light green
01:14:49.719 Celadon blade of the godkin Apostles
01:14:52.239 simply for increasing the thrust speed
01:14:54.840 if it works the thrusts from
01:14:56.880 specifically the weapon regardless of
01:14:58.880 wielder are swifter than the eye can
01:15:01.440 follow but is there some other secret is
01:15:05.000 Selin's glint Stone a sickly poison
01:15:07.639 green evidence of her Twisted mind she
01:15:11.040 was the Graven witch after all and how
01:15:14.639 to explain this remarkable green sky on
01:15:17.400 that fateful night of the black knives
01:15:20.040 perhaps you have spotted a similar sky
01:15:21.920 in your playthrough too there is one
01:15:25.080 poisoning game that is not green that is
01:15:27.560 called rot what is Scarlet rot once
01:15:31.239 again it is named by color and from its
01:15:33.480 name we have the answer if there is more
01:15:36.320 and more energy Green in life and bodies
01:15:40.120 red what happened what did we say was
01:15:43.159 the color more energetic life moved to
01:15:46.000 as it became more madly mobile more
01:15:49.280 chaotic red Trends to Yellow which is
01:15:53.239 exactly what you get when you mix red
01:15:55.400 and green and one of the closest shades
01:15:58.199 of red to the border of yellow or chaos
01:16:01.400 is
01:16:03.080 [Music]
01:16:05.560 Scarlet Scarlet is life but too
01:16:08.639 manically energetic it grows and lives
01:16:11.639 too vigorously and chaotically consuming
01:16:14.960 and destroying its host life out of
01:16:22.400 control Scarlet brings us to the idea of
01:16:25.320 colors being similar being
01:16:27.800 neighbors of course there is no one
01:16:30.239 nature for any color it is all
01:16:34.000 Hues what is the order and relationship
01:16:36.920 of color in a natural splitting of
01:16:39.280 colors from White Light we can see it
01:16:41.440 clearly red is on one side of the split
01:16:44.320 leading to Yellow to green to blue and
01:16:47.600 then to purple the shades of these
01:16:49.760 colors are infinitely varied as it goes
01:16:51.880 between them every color can be made by
01:16:54.320 the two that border it on either side so
01:16:57.040 a wheel can be formed as a famous
01:16:59.239 Alchemist did long ago more than the
01:17:02.080 darkness or lightness where is the color
01:17:04.800 exactly how close is it to others the
01:17:08.080 Hue as we have mentioned May divide
01:17:10.199 gravity nature from sleep but there is
01:17:12.560 no strict Border in any of their Natures
01:17:15.560 everything can approach and mix heresy
01:17:19.080 is not native to the world it is but a
01:17:23.159 contrivance all things can be
01:17:26.320 conjoined so red going too close to
01:17:29.600 Yellow gives Scarlet chaotic life is
01:17:32.960 Scarlet rot blue gains some green and it
01:17:36.120 becomes energized full of innovation and
01:17:38.920 impact on the real world but too much
01:17:41.320 green and the mind cannot keep the
01:17:43.120 stability for things like attention or
01:17:45.320 memory become too green a shade of
01:17:48.000 turquoise and you might be called a
01:17:50.239 blunt Stone perhaps being this H his
01:17:52.840 whole life led thops to a great in
01:17:54.840 Insight a mind that is internally over
01:17:57.520 animated repels the entry of external
01:18:00.000 mental
01:18:01.120 influence it raises the question of
01:18:03.440 whether sorcery damage really arises
01:18:05.639 simply from strong mental belief moving
01:18:09.080 further away from Blue moves further
01:18:11.239 away from sentients and more into the
01:18:13.400 automatic animations of the natural
01:18:15.679 world comets represent this always much
01:18:18.800 more green than the Bluer stars and are
01:18:21.600 never referred to as
01:18:23.320 sentient stars are on the other hand are
01:18:25.600 referred to repeatedly as active
01:18:28.199 conscious
01:18:30.159 agents green animation moved towards
01:18:32.800 yellow is poison mind and body mix into
01:18:36.600 the purple worlds of sleep dreams and
01:18:39.960 the Mystic and inanimate bodies moving
01:18:43.040 with what seems to be minds of their own
01:18:45.600 is purple
01:18:47.159 gravity most interestingly and what
01:18:50.040 really shows the purposeful nature of
01:18:51.960 Elden Ring's color design is in opposite
01:18:55.760 colors may have associations in our
01:18:57.560 world but their opposite associations do
01:18:59.920 not match to their color opposites what
01:19:02.760 do we mean by that well for most color
01:19:05.199 systems opposite associations do not
01:19:07.600 have opposite colors or light
01:19:09.600 wavelengths and vice versa thus we do
01:19:12.440 not find in our world that the
01:19:13.880 associations of purple are the opposite
01:19:16.159 of the associations of green the odds of
01:19:18.840 them doing so is remarkably low if they
01:19:21.600 did you might start to say that it was a
01:19:24.000 natural law
01:19:25.480 but what do we find in Elden ring white
01:19:28.040 and black are the two opposites of time
01:19:30.320 but it is a scale for all colors and
01:19:32.960 gray the mess and mix of time States
01:19:35.560 when inverted is still gray it has no
01:19:39.639 time opposite unlike black or white so
01:19:43.560 what about true Hues the opposite of red
01:19:47.800 heat is ice hued blue the opposite of
01:19:52.239 chaos the rational mind regulating and
01:19:55.800 maintaining
01:19:57.159 control the opposite of purple the
01:19:59.800 sinking dragging sleep and gravity force
01:20:02.960 is green the animating uplifting energy
01:20:06.120 of stamina and
01:20:08.239 Cycles clearly this is a conscious
01:20:10.960 design for the law of Elden
01:20:16.360 ring let's move on to some more nuanced
01:20:20.480 colors there are some unique colors some
01:20:24.000 more common some
01:20:25.679 rare but all
01:20:28.720 [Music]
01:20:31.080 mysterious silver whether in the real
01:20:33.920 world or Elden ring always takes second
01:20:36.719 place to Gold often the name for money
01:20:39.639 in various cultures it is much more
01:20:41.719 practical than the hard to come by gold
01:20:44.639 silver is the most reflective metal and
01:20:47.520 the best conductor of electricity and
01:20:50.199 heat it really can seem to become one
01:20:53.280 with things visually and energetically
01:20:56.239 in Elden ring the nature of silver is
01:20:58.400 similar but much more magical silver
01:21:01.679 seems in nature quite similar to Quicks
01:21:04.360 silver or its other name Mercury while
01:21:08.239 this metal is not referenced in game the
01:21:10.440 silver we find seems to flow and run
01:21:13.040 like liquid silver tears a liquid nox
01:21:16.400 weapons stretch and warp forms from this
01:21:19.280 same tier the center of this creature is
01:21:22.159 a lval tier within which we can see the
01:21:24.719 apparent liquid flow of silver under its
01:21:27.159 surface in alchemy silver is associated
01:21:30.199 with the moon and snakes silver doesn't
01:21:34.239 appear in any of the all color or
01:21:36.719 multicolor items it doesn't seem to be
01:21:39.199 part of the mainstream world and
01:21:41.239 arrangement of colors Mercury being a
01:21:44.679 liquid metal is perceived in alchemy as
01:21:46.920 being able to cross natur's and borders
01:21:50.040 it also competes with silver for its
01:21:52.040 reflectivity and has been used in
01:21:53.880 telescopes for this property most
01:21:56.639 interestingly almost all elements can
01:21:59.080 combine with Mercury in a process called
01:22:02.320 amalgamation both silver and Quicksilver
01:22:05.080 seem to have the ability to take on the
01:22:06.920 properties of other things whether
01:22:09.000 visually or physically absorbing or in
01:22:11.760 its heat or electric nature in Elden
01:22:14.600 ring silver truly takes on the nature of
01:22:17.360 others we can even birth ourselves a new
01:22:19.960 with this silver and it is hinted that
01:22:22.480 maybe a lord can be made by a silver
01:22:25.520 imitation while this nature of silver
01:22:27.760 seems to be a pattern it is still a
01:22:29.920 mystery why is the metal of Trina's
01:22:32.639 sword full of purple magic silver to
01:22:36.280 conduct the realm of Dreams is Oracle
01:22:39.440 Envoy blood silver they look somewhat
01:22:42.400 similar white and blue to the white
01:22:44.520 blooded aloric and aloric were formed
01:22:47.880 from a sacred drop of Jew was that Jew
01:22:51.120 as silver as the shield that represents
01:22:53.600 it and what is blue silver a mysterious
01:22:57.960 metal born from the same mother as
01:23:00.159 aloric
01:23:04.960 themselves Amber is perplexing Amber in
01:23:09.000 our world is fossilized tree resin
01:23:12.000 different color ambers form from the her
01:23:14.000 tree old sap as in our world sap and
01:23:17.239 time are the ingredients the various
01:23:19.920 Hues of Amber match the various Natures
01:23:22.199 of color however most important is the
01:23:24.920 traditional color of amber it is very
01:23:27.840 connected to the process of rebirth the
01:23:30.719 Amber egg of rala is a beautiful example
01:23:33.760 why is rebirth this color and more
01:23:36.600 confusingly why does it need silver to
01:23:39.719 operate the sacred DW drop here
01:23:42.280 represented in the silver mirror Shield
01:23:44.280 has Amber a top it another Strange
01:23:47.199 Relation Amber Starlight says that Amber
01:23:50.239 hued stars must command the gods the
01:23:53.320 draft made to attempt to to control Rani
01:23:55.480 is an Amber draft this color seems to
01:23:58.320 have something to do with formation
01:24:00.880 formation of Life formation of a future
01:24:04.120 and fate but it is a color of mystery we
01:24:07.199 need to
01:24:08.360 explore what is Glo Gloom is Twilight or
01:24:13.199 the darker part of Twilight Gloom shade
01:24:17.960 given what we know about the colors and
01:24:19.800 relation to death Glo would be a fitting
01:24:22.560 color for the Queen's eyes
01:24:24.880 who it might be remains in the
01:24:29.440 dark copper is another color that is
01:24:32.000 also a metal copper appears vividly in
01:24:34.920 certain swords regalia of a says that
01:24:38.159 the copper coloration of the blade is a
01:24:40.400 conduit for its wielder to move it by
01:24:42.520 their will alone We Believe copper is
01:24:45.400 therefore the color of the will the
01:24:48.040 region that uses this sword also gave us
01:24:50.320 Elma of the Bri his shield from a
01:24:52.880 foreign land is the land of a a land of
01:24:56.800 proudly solitary Aesthetics aesthetic is
01:25:00.159 defined as characterized by severe
01:25:02.600 self-discipline and abent from all forms
01:25:05.760 of indulgence this sword is from a
01:25:08.119 region where willpower is immensely
01:25:10.119 important and practiced daily the will
01:25:13.400 is the color of
01:25:15.679 copper bronze seems to support this
01:25:18.639 bronze is an alloy mostly of copper and
01:25:21.480 a little tin the gargoyle seem to be
01:25:24.360 operated from afar their swords are made
01:25:26.800 of bronze as are the Hoops on their
01:25:28.760 ankles and wrists almost like a puppet
01:25:32.480 Tin Men moved by the will at distance
01:25:36.159 additionally how does one make copper
01:25:38.560 color you mix a lot of yellow chaos a
01:25:42.440 lot of red animal life and raw instincts
01:25:45.719 with a little blue what could better
01:25:48.920 represent willpower than copper when a
01:25:52.159 little bit of mind or Spirit has to
01:25:54.360 fight as the underdog against the chaos
01:25:56.520 of the world and the Bas of desires to
01:25:59.040 do what you truly wish to do will is
01:26:02.000 found in this hardship where one must
01:26:04.400 compete against these two natures and
01:26:10.639 win there is one remarkable color in
01:26:13.600 game that is not truly a color drained
01:26:17.159 of
01:26:18.360 color according to the natures of color
01:26:21.119 this type of color should be defined by
01:26:23.639 its empty of Nature and this is just
01:26:26.480 what we see Eclipse Crest Great Shield
01:26:29.239 says the eclipsed sun drained of color
01:26:32.520 is the protective star of soulless
01:26:34.880 demigods it is an emptiness that matters
01:26:37.639 here the edge is the symbol that matters
01:26:41.159 soless demigods have lost their Natures
01:26:44.119 their bodies lie drained of red Vigor
01:26:46.760 the animation the mind the character the
01:26:49.639 soul has left this plane they are
01:26:53.119 colorless nent butterfly an important
01:26:56.320 ingredient in many consumables has
01:26:58.560 translucent Wings it appears as if it
01:27:01.800 has just emerged from its cocoon for its
01:27:04.239 entire life it has very little nature
01:27:08.320 colorlessness can be filled it is pure
01:27:11.600 potential nent butterfly makes dappled
01:27:14.679 multicolored meat it doesn't interfere
01:27:17.280 with these Hues it is colorless and can
01:27:20.080 take on varieties of colors without
01:27:21.920 staining it with its own this concept
01:27:24.679 comes again with somber smithing Stone
01:27:27.159 somber being defined as dull in color or
01:27:30.080 tone the description of the stone again
01:27:32.440 reminds us that color is an essential
01:27:34.440 building block of the world Shard of
01:27:36.960 smithing Stone drained of color What A
01:27:39.880 peculiar thing for a blacksmith to find
01:27:42.639 important finally it says special
01:27:45.520 armaments with unique characteristics
01:27:47.760 cannot be strengthened with colored
01:27:49.440 smithing Stones color has nature
01:27:52.760 intrinsically and IR removably if
01:27:55.560 something is a unique and balanced mix
01:27:57.800 of colors to use a colored Stone would
01:28:00.440 literally change its nature therefore to
01:28:03.320 maintain its uniqueness of nature which
01:28:05.840 in Elden ring means its remarkable
01:28:07.719 uniqueness of color you need to use a
01:28:10.440 colorless smithing
01:28:13.880 Stone so
01:28:16.639 multicolored now we know the basics we
01:28:19.080 can approach these remarkable dappled
01:28:21.840 patterns there are of course many base
01:28:24.639 colors we can therefore make a
01:28:26.840 prediction before looking in game
01:28:29.520 multicolored consumables in Elden ring
01:28:32.080 should have the same effect as its
01:28:34.280 constituent colors indeed multicolored
01:28:37.480 is achieved by the most basic function
01:28:40.639 of something else these colors after all
01:28:43.920 are not mixing but first dappled rainbow
01:28:49.000 mled it goes by many names the mled
01:28:52.840 necklace from entirely different culture
01:28:55.560 to the UR Trey has very clearly three
01:28:58.360 colors on it poison green purple and red
01:29:02.639 the exact colors of the more ordinary
01:29:05.159 immunizing clarifying and stalwart
01:29:07.960 charms what is the effect of this
01:29:10.520 vividly colored accoutrement precious to
01:29:13.080 the ancestral followers it raises
01:29:15.600 robustness immunity and focus just like
01:29:19.239 our colors would dictate and a
01:29:21.280 combination of the more regular colored
01:29:23.360 horn chants
01:29:24.679 our prediction is right this pattern
01:29:27.760 fits across many items flask of wondrous
01:29:31.080 physic a relic of the physic chemists
01:29:33.760 Priests of the earthree what a curious
01:29:36.880 profession for priests to focus on the
01:29:39.199 mixing and combinations of Bas Natures
01:29:42.639 harnesses the power of Crystal tears
01:29:44.920 which only form after the passage of
01:29:46.840 many moons various special effects are
01:29:49.280 bestowed upon the Drinker dependent on
01:29:51.400 the specific mixture of Crystal tears of
01:29:54.560 course there are many colors of Tears
01:29:56.840 crimson and green and so on and with
01:29:59.880 custom combinations the vision of their
01:30:01.840 effect is
01:30:04.600 multicolored one special tiar is the
01:30:07.400 opaline hard tiar opaline is another
01:30:10.639 word for opalescent defined as showing
01:30:13.440 many small points of Shifting color
01:30:16.440 against a pale or dark ground opal is
01:30:19.760 famous for being able to display every
01:30:22.119 color of the rainbow if Crimson tear and
01:30:25.440 green tear affect HP and stamina what
01:30:28.719 does this multicolored tear do it boosts
01:30:32.199 all forms of damage negation the dappled
01:30:35.840 cured meat we make upon closer
01:30:37.880 inspection has three colors that stain
01:30:40.400 it red purple and poison green and what
01:30:44.560 do these cured meats do when we consume
01:30:46.920 them dappled cured meat boosts immunity
01:30:50.239 robustness and focus exactly what the
01:30:53.119 colors red purple and off green do when
01:30:55.960 alone in a cured meat what is remarkable
01:30:59.280 too is how we make dappled cured meat
01:31:02.920 the medicinal solution we cure it in
01:31:05.040 doesn't have a combination of the
01:31:07.080 essential ingredients of other meats the
01:31:09.960 invigorating cured meat red has a land
01:31:13.000 octopus ovary in it but it is not in
01:31:16.159 dappled meat we don't find a slumbering
01:31:18.840 egg for the Sleep resistance nor a head
01:31:21.239 of a poison resistant dragonfly there is
01:31:24.440 one item that seems to give all the
01:31:26.800 variety of color to the dappled meat a
01:31:29.960 budding horn this horn began to sprout
01:31:33.480 on a beast that typically Bears no horn
01:31:36.560 perhaps it's a vestage of the primordial
01:31:39.280 Crucible this horn gives rise to many
01:31:42.400 colors what is the primordial Crucible
01:31:45.880 where all life was once Blended together
01:31:49.440 all life all natures and therefore all
01:31:53.560 color
01:31:54.500 [Music]
01:31:57.199 with the nature of multicolored
01:31:58.840 established we can look at where it
01:32:00.719 appears in the law we can understand why
01:32:03.679 the rarest and most prized of Miranda
01:32:06.280 flowers are the most varied in color
01:32:08.880 there is a great power in the diversity
01:32:11.040 of uses Asel formed of many colors
01:32:14.560 together can cast various forms of magic
01:32:17.719 and indeed amongst all this varied color
01:32:21.480 appear rings
01:32:24.000 why are the celebrants in the Windmill
01:32:25.880 Village armed with multicolored rakes
01:32:28.760 skulls and sickles the merchants wear
01:32:32.280 gorgeous multicolored garments their
01:32:34.880 famously Suave hats studded With Many
01:32:37.719 Colored gemstones is this the LIE of the
01:32:40.920 three fingers that removing division
01:32:43.800 will bring together this diversity in
01:32:46.320 Beauty instead of Destruction in chaos
01:32:50.600 the gods themselves seem to be a
01:32:52.679 multicolored SE
01:32:54.440 the outer God of scarlet rot the god of
01:32:57.080 rani's order the formless mother and so
01:33:00.679 on perhaps white and black is like a
01:33:03.639 many-faced god acting as many colors but
01:33:07.679 in fact is one colors are so fundamental
01:33:12.119 that the very Gods seem to be divided by
01:33:14.480 them and one God the greater will is
01:33:18.000 recognized by one exceptional color but
01:33:22.040 nothing is so important in the law of
01:33:24.520 the multicolored Than The Crucible and
01:33:28.400 the
01:33:31.639 Omens Omens with the nature of All
01:33:34.600 Creatures emerging have much more than a
01:33:36.960 vestage of the primordial Crucible if
01:33:40.000 yellow is a chaos of everything mixing
01:33:42.560 multicolored is something to be nervous
01:33:44.880 of how things can be multicolored
01:33:47.400 without mixing to chaos is the place of
01:33:49.679 a most famous color and Omens are
01:33:52.360 evidence of the breakdown of this color
01:33:55.280 as the boundaries of color begin to
01:33:57.159 weaken and stir up how close we come to
01:34:01.199 chaos morgot is an omen who knows he is
01:34:04.320 a risk he is ashamed of his curse he
01:34:07.679 recanted it and sealed it away in his
01:34:10.080 cursed sword a beautiful lore item
01:34:13.360 warped blade of Shifting Hue the colors
01:34:17.320 tell us his story what is an omen but a
01:34:20.560 warped being with many colored Natures
01:34:23.119 shifting and emerging the accursed blood
01:34:26.080 that more got recanted and sealed away
01:34:28.679 reformed into this blade when this Blood
01:34:32.119 becomes Unbound it emerges it explodes
01:34:35.639 and mixes in a filthy off yellow
01:34:38.719 staining the Thrones staining an
01:34:41.840 important word explicitly a word for
01:34:44.800 color Omens and Omen blood and all that
01:34:48.280 Trends towards the primordial Crucible
01:34:50.880 risk blending in a stew of mess One Step
01:34:54.560 from Pure chaos but it is kept at Bay
01:34:58.719 kept at Bay by one
01:35:01.400 thing
01:35:03.770 [Music]
01:35:18.040 gold in our world gold is formed in
01:35:20.800 stars and is believed to have fallen to
01:35:23.040 the Earth in meteorites long ago it is
01:35:25.960 unreactive and one of the most stable
01:35:28.639 elements it is very hard to destroy and
01:35:31.960 very hard to make and of course it has a
01:35:35.040 unique color in alchemy it is viewed as
01:35:37.920 the highest form of matter but not only
01:35:40.480 matter also body mind and soul to turn
01:35:44.480 base Metals matter or our own nature
01:35:47.760 into gold takes many stages but gold is
01:35:51.040 the final form this transformation has
01:35:53.960 been undertaken by many great minds in
01:35:55.920 history but while they gave us many
01:35:58.239 other gifts gold was never made in Elden
01:36:02.280 ring we need to look at the world and
01:36:04.800 what is in it to see Gold's place in the
01:36:08.159 universe gold is seen all around us but
01:36:11.440 it is hard to find on its own removed
01:36:14.119 from complex systems religion characters
01:36:17.920 obscure dialogue none of these help us
01:36:20.480 as Gold beginners complexity will lead
01:36:23.280 to confusion we need to find where gold
01:36:25.960 is in the world simply and there are
01:36:29.080 three items which are natural simple and
01:36:33.360 importantly ignored there won't be any
01:36:36.679 preconceptions about what has been
01:36:38.719 passed by Golden rower gold tinged
01:36:42.480 excrement and Beast blood first golden
01:36:47.119 rower red rower as we have dealt with is
01:36:50.280 heavily involved in red nature boosting
01:36:53.119 gold rower is a rarer thing though it is
01:36:55.960 easily found near the her tree gold is
01:36:58.440 easier to find in General near the her
01:37:00.719 tree more than color how does this gold
01:37:03.400 rower differ from a typical rower in
01:37:06.360 what we can
01:37:08.440 make red rower and rhymed rower cannot
01:37:11.679 make any dappled Meats dappled as we
01:37:15.119 have addressed are multicolored they
01:37:17.400 have the effects of each color yet the
01:37:19.920 meat has identifiable separate colors in
01:37:23.119 its St pling why can the preserving
01:37:25.600 effects of a normal rower not do what is
01:37:27.960 required to make dappled meat but gold
01:37:30.520 rower can gold is required to stop the
01:37:34.280 colors from mixing it contains the
01:37:37.480 colors in the meat together yet separate
01:37:41.560 gold tinged excrement is next once again
01:37:44.679 it has a unique appearance it has a
01:37:47.239 golden tinge but we have an enormous
01:37:49.920 clue in this highly ignored substance
01:37:52.719 gold tinge excrement is a highly stable
01:37:55.760 substance it doesn't dry out nor does it
01:37:58.440 lose its customary warmth or scent for
01:38:01.560 better or worse it remains as it is
01:38:05.199 goldness maintains the nature of the
01:38:09.040 thing finally we have fresh Beast blood
01:38:13.119 glinting with gold this glimmering Blood
01:38:16.400 never rots or decays between these items
01:38:20.119 the essential nature of gold reveals
01:38:22.480 itself gold is order gold has the power
01:38:27.440 to hold things in a state or condition
01:38:29.960 that otherwise might change in a
01:38:32.400 universe where the natures of things are
01:38:34.199 linked with color gold is what can hold
01:38:36.719 them in relation gold dictates whether
01:38:39.760 they overlap mix or are held at a great
01:38:43.119 remove without gold dappled meat would
01:38:46.119 be very dangerous to eat as its colors
01:38:48.679 would interfere with each other without
01:38:51.119 gold things rot without gold for better
01:38:54.679 or worse things change
01:38:57.480 unpredictably each color has its
01:38:59.480 opposite in nature but gold is not a
01:39:01.719 base color it is an emergent property
01:39:04.360 and an emergent color just like chaos
01:39:08.880 and yellow is the shadow of
01:39:11.560 gold gold is what can divide and
01:39:14.360 distinguish and yellow destroys
01:39:16.760 divisions interestingly what is one
01:39:19.320 thing that can break gold down in the
01:39:21.440 real world aqua IA dissolves gold away
01:39:25.639 its color a vivid yellow gold and order
01:39:29.840 is like yellow and Chaos it exists and
01:39:33.280 doesn't exist it is an emergence color
01:39:35.920 when all colors are in certain orders
01:39:38.960 you have faith in Gold you can see it
01:39:41.320 feel it but it doesn't exist in the way
01:39:44.000 green does break the structure and gold
01:39:47.040 vanishes into its constituent Parts with
01:39:49.840 the true colors within revealing
01:39:51.920 themselves
01:39:55.100 [Music]
01:39:56.880 if gold is order gold may have the power
01:40:00.080 of influencing the basic rules of the
01:40:02.800 universe after all what are rules
01:40:05.880 whether in society or the laws of nature
01:40:08.800 other than order with enough gold you
01:40:12.159 can guide these laws as you see fit you
01:40:15.119 can make things rise or fall you can
01:40:17.800 make them burn freeze reverse in time
01:40:21.560 you can temper your own being with blue
01:40:24.679 you can choose how long red lasts how
01:40:28.360 much green your amount of purple the
01:40:32.239 enigmatic Miyazaki told us so before the
01:40:34.880 game's release the Rings you're looking
01:40:37.040 at in the logo are more a representation
01:40:40.119 of the law of the world the rules and
01:40:42.840 the order it's more about how you apply
01:40:45.440 those rules and how you enforce them on
01:40:47.520 the physical world and what effects they
01:40:49.920 have on it that's what's being
01:40:51.719 represented by the Elden ring and these
01:40:53.880 overlapping and intersecting Rings it
01:40:56.639 gets a little bit more complicated than
01:40:58.639 that but I'll leave it there for now
01:41:01.880 like dams in rivers with gold you can
01:41:04.800 direct nature itself whether it helps
01:41:07.719 the world in general or only yourself
01:41:10.520 depends on your understanding and your
01:41:14.119 choices the current imperfection of the
01:41:16.800 golden order or instability of ideology
01:41:20.080 can be blamed upon the fickleness of the
01:41:22.360 Gods Know better than
01:41:24.800 men let us now look at more complicated
01:41:27.639 aspects of gold and see if things fall
01:41:29.800 into
01:41:31.400 place the shackles for Omens have golden
01:41:34.280 symbols on them and they are bathed in
01:41:36.920 golden magic they confine Omens
01:41:40.679 confinement is a form of order and now
01:41:43.520 we have learned the multicolored nature
01:41:45.280 of Omens isn't this just dappled meat
01:41:48.679 and golden rower but played at a much
01:41:51.040 larger scale only Omens the same as
01:41:54.480 anything else are defined by their
01:41:56.800 colors Omens are too primordial too
01:42:00.000 verging on the chaotic if let out to mix
01:42:03.119 it becomes
01:42:05.040 disordered gold like the golden rower
01:42:08.040 keeps these shifting Hues in place
01:42:10.760 morgot has the nature of what seems to
01:42:12.840 be rats goats and many other creatures
01:42:15.760 growing from him and when the seal he
01:42:18.080 imposed on his own blood seems to break
01:42:20.599 it is splinters of gold he coughs out
01:42:22.920 first first before the emergence of a
01:42:25.360 muddy mixed
01:42:27.719 color order is very linked to time if
01:42:32.040 order is buffeted by non-order it
01:42:34.560 dissipates over time this is why morot
01:42:37.480 shackle which lacks power only holds
01:42:39.920 morot for a short time this is why with
01:42:42.880 time gold seems to Decay to a muddy
01:42:45.560 yellow colors naturally mix and thus
01:42:49.119 just as golden rower is needed for cured
01:42:51.320 meat so too do we the player need runes
01:42:56.480 runes are the gold that keep ourselves
01:42:58.679 in order without runes we cannot keep
01:43:01.520 any of the natures of color if we
01:43:03.800 consume redness a boost occurs but it
01:43:06.280 cannot be maintained permanently and it
01:43:08.760 fades the golden runes that can maintain
01:43:11.800 Nature's in order can allow us to keep
01:43:14.599 different attributes permanently think
01:43:17.239 of it like having more gold to add to
01:43:19.360 our own ring it increases its size runes
01:43:23.679 will act as nourishment for the
01:43:25.400 development of any tarnished if we want
01:43:28.520 more green permanently we can do that
01:43:31.679 more runes allows us to alter our own
01:43:34.560 form our own order without order these
01:43:38.119 Natures will mix we don't necessarily
01:43:40.800 want a strong body to dilute with a
01:43:43.199 strong mind to result in tiredness order
01:43:46.480 can raise the parts to a greater hole it
01:43:49.679 may be that all the basic building
01:43:51.760 blocks of nature are around us all the
01:43:54.480 time much like in the real world
01:43:56.840 everything is only its specific nature
01:43:59.040 as a result of its
01:44:02.159 order order does not only apply to the
01:44:05.000 inner it also applies to the outer world
01:44:07.800 you can impose order on others just as
01:44:10.280 you can impose disorder one more
01:44:12.840 complicated aspect of golden order a
01:44:15.280 name which takes a more literal meaning
01:44:17.400 now is
01:44:18.840 incantations one spell that imposes
01:44:21.119 order on others is litany of proper
01:44:23.800 death we cast it upon those who live in
01:44:26.199 death and it stops them from arising
01:44:28.199 repeatedly the description once again is
01:44:30.719 more concerned about image than the
01:44:32.920 physical it imposes an image of order in
01:44:36.440 bright gold which damages those who live
01:44:38.840 in death the spell says the hunters aim
01:44:41.599 to Stamp Out defiled reason all for the
01:44:44.480 Perfection of the golden order in their
01:44:47.320 opinion to live in death is an affront
01:44:49.920 to how order should be however the very
01:44:53.239 name living in death shows how flexible
01:44:56.239 order can be that such a thing is even
01:44:59.560 possible the image of order is
01:45:01.920 interesting too what shape does order
01:45:04.520 always take clear intersecting straight
01:45:07.920 lines triangles and squares and of
01:45:11.119 course most famously in rings what is
01:45:15.000 more ordered than a ring holding an
01:45:17.639 inner and separating an outer balanced
01:45:20.679 around its Center rings are a per
01:45:23.000 perfect visual representation of order
01:45:26.040 they can contain they can overlap and
01:45:30.800 bind other spell effects and
01:45:32.880 descriptions help us further two
01:45:35.119 incantations viewed as very important to
01:45:37.239 the law are the law of regression and
01:45:39.320 the law of causality causality one of
01:45:42.639 the key fundamentals manifests a small
01:45:45.239 ring of causality within that allows the
01:45:47.520 Caster to automatically retaliate upon
01:45:50.119 receiving a certain number of Blows the
01:45:52.480 fundamental ists describe the golden
01:45:54.440 order through the powers of regression
01:45:56.560 and causality causality is the pull
01:45:59.440 between meanings it is the connections
01:46:01.960 that form the relationships of all
01:46:04.800 things this is one more key this is
01:46:07.800 because it is fundamental to understand
01:46:09.960 that order is not only static something
01:46:13.119 being in a state of order unchanging
01:46:15.480 through time is of course ordered but
01:46:18.280 there is order in processes too that
01:46:20.760 which repeats or has a pattern that
01:46:23.480 which is predictable cause and effect
01:46:26.280 fundamentally if it is tightly
01:46:28.239 correlated is a form of order it is
01:46:31.360 order through time so with this we can
01:46:34.840 establish that order is not only
01:46:36.840 something that applies to things with
01:46:38.440 static states such as Beast blood not
01:46:40.800 rotting it applies to processes just as
01:46:43.520 a dam will consistently redirect water
01:46:46.159 in this or that direction over time the
01:46:49.800 next is law of regression heals all
01:46:52.480 negative statuses dispels special
01:46:54.920 effects and reveals mimicry in all its
01:46:57.320 forms regression is the pull of meaning
01:47:00.360 that all things yearn eternally to
01:47:03.119 converge this is inverting causality or
01:47:06.639 removing effect any form of order is
01:47:09.639 expensive and to do this at a deeper
01:47:11.840 level say a wide area or deeper into the
01:47:15.440 past I.E through more layers of cause
01:47:18.239 and effect takes a lot of order it is
01:47:21.760 expensive
01:47:23.440 it is easy to damage order with chaos
01:47:26.000 but undoing order cleanly backwards is
01:47:29.639 not chaos it is a very hard operation
01:47:32.599 that also requires a lot of order all
01:47:36.000 incantations are of Interest here as
01:47:38.119 well Im mutable Shield protects one's
01:47:40.880 own order Lord's Aid and cure poison use
01:47:44.560 a great abundance of order to draw out
01:47:47.440 poisons and ailments from our bodies and
01:47:50.320 we can see these colors being removed
01:47:53.920 finally we have order healing all the
01:47:57.119 good and the great wanted was an
01:47:59.199 absolute evil to contend with does such
01:48:02.400 a notion exist in the fundamentals of
01:48:06.639 order so we get to the moral aspect of
01:48:10.080 order who benefits from order what does
01:48:13.719 benefit even mean without order before
01:48:16.800 the existence of order can we talk about
01:48:19.880 good or
01:48:21.760 evil both if they exist arise from order
01:48:26.320 the benefit or harm of a dam its gain to
01:48:29.280 some its harm to others is already
01:48:32.119 placed at top an order can something as
01:48:35.159 fundamental as order itself have a
01:48:38.679 morality after all with chaos such
01:48:41.719 things fall down melan tells us as such
01:48:46.000 if you intend to claim the frenzied
01:48:48.239 flame I ask that you
01:48:51.280 cease it is not not to be meddled with
01:48:54.760 it is chaos devouring life and thought
01:48:58.560 unending however ruined this world has
01:49:02.119 become however mired in torment and
01:49:05.400 despair life
01:49:07.639 endures births continue There is Beauty
01:49:11.639 in that is there not if you would become
01:49:16.520 Lord do not deny this notion
01:49:20.520 please leave the frenzied Flame name
01:49:23.639 alone life itself is destroyed in chaos
01:49:27.440 the pain and suffering of life is also
01:49:30.199 order it is division and distinguishment
01:49:33.400 frenzy removes the order of pain just as
01:49:36.320 the eye of yellow relieves it without
01:49:38.760 suffering of any kind we would die order
01:49:41.880 contains perhaps IR removably suffering
01:49:45.520 but is a mixed quality of life better
01:49:48.159 than none at all the Lord of frenzied
01:49:50.960 flame is no Lord at all
01:49:53.320 when the land they preside over is
01:49:56.719 lifeless chaos is a release but a well
01:50:00.280 structured order may do wonders and this
01:50:03.840 range of the possibilities of order is
01:50:06.000 the purpose of gold mask the state of
01:50:08.760 the current order is weakening and
01:50:10.599 disorder has become more
01:50:12.719 present the fallen
01:50:15.199 leaves tell a
01:50:18.159 story gold is fading even small
01:50:21.000 distances from the her tree is it
01:50:23.360 because gold is alloyed with something
01:50:25.760 outer allowing the influence of outer
01:50:28.159 Gods is it unstable ideology and
01:50:31.000 fickleness that is the problem or is it
01:50:33.480 the physical damage done to the Elden
01:50:35.320 ring that is causing these issues gold
01:50:38.520 Mark takes on the task of mending order
01:50:41.679 his change to fundamental order impacts
01:50:44.280 everything and everyone in the lands
01:50:46.360 between in fact the form of order is
01:50:49.040 what defines every ending in alen ring
01:50:51.199 many orders are possible
01:50:53.320 unlike others who create a mending Rune
01:50:55.719 gold mask invests incomparable time and
01:50:59.040 thought into his creation he has likely
01:51:01.840 spent a lifetime to reach his level of
01:51:04.760 understanding staring up through holes
01:51:07.040 in his mask not unlike a pinhole camera
01:51:09.719 he observes the world is the mask
01:51:12.320 splitting colors so he can analyze their
01:51:14.719 true Natures he seems to care about the
01:51:17.440 fate of the world Beyond his own
01:51:21.119 self-interest we should be glad for it
01:51:23.920 it is an enormous responsibility to lay
01:51:26.119 down the order for all others order in a
01:51:29.159 sense is innately unnatural get it wrong
01:51:32.320 and it may have been better to do
01:51:33.960 nothing but there are huge benefits to
01:51:36.679 tempering your nature for yourself and
01:51:39.320 others this is why gold Mark's Work is
01:51:42.440 all about transcending the culmination
01:51:45.440 of his work is The Mending Rune of
01:51:47.560 perfect order a rune of transcendental
01:51:50.440 ideology which will attempt to per
01:51:52.599 effect the golden order will this allow
01:51:55.719 Vivid color to return to the tarnished
01:51:57.880 and the lands between gold mask has
01:52:00.639 achieved something miraculous when his
01:52:02.760 Rune starts an age of order whether it
01:52:06.199 will succeed in the long term though
01:52:08.360 only time will
01:52:10.480 tell gold is colors set in order we can
01:52:14.400 see it when it breaks and ceases to Glow
01:52:17.520 its colors revealed
01:52:23.480 gold can be a shackle but gold can be
01:52:26.760 Freedom all that is cursed or evil is
01:52:30.480 order but so too is every gift in life
01:52:34.280 order to choose its alternative is
01:52:37.679 madness to know ourselves our nature our
01:52:41.599 colors is a path we must follow just as
01:52:44.480 gold mask followed his never impose
01:52:47.560 order carelessly instead walking this
01:52:50.400 path of understanding may give the
01:52:52.119 insight to harness our own Natures to
01:52:54.880 lay down our own rings to gain strength
01:52:58.719 of all forms to be present to earn
01:53:02.639 comfort with what we cannot control or
01:53:05.520 understand to be more in harmony too
01:53:10.199 much and you are out of control too
01:53:13.000 little you're ineffective too intense
01:53:16.480 you'll never last too light and you Fade
01:53:19.920 Away in time our actions
01:53:23.040 thoughts energy instincts and even
01:53:26.159 emotions can be brought to Harmony with
01:53:29.199 time and battle after all the Creator
01:53:33.280 called gold the concepts of order and
01:53:38.079 discipline just as gold won its place in
01:53:40.760 Elden ring anyone can conquer their own
01:53:43.560 lands between anyone even if you feel
01:53:46.880 your colors are tarnished can
01:53:49.719 transcend to gold

01:54:28.320 bogur might have changed the world he
01:54:31.880 isn't as intelligent as gold mask but he
01:54:35.360 has intuition in time he just might have
01:54:39.719 mended the lands between because bogot
01:54:43.400 was on to
01:54:44.920 something blackard big bog is Born Into
01:54:48.760 A Big World his arrival is not blessed
01:54:52.840 he is not born at the foot of the earth
01:54:54.760 tree or into a well-off family only
01:54:57.960 those of comfort and means know the
01:55:00.440 truth a crab's eggs are more delectable
01:55:03.440 than its meat bogot will go on to eat
01:55:07.040 and sell crab meat but never sells the
01:55:09.840 eggs he doesn't know this truth because
01:55:13.159 he has never experienced Comfort or
01:55:17.440 wealth after an early life of hardship
01:55:20.480 he grows into an aggressive man he
01:55:23.400 learns to fight he learns to threaten he
01:55:26.719 learns to Bluff and he learns to cook
01:55:29.800 the food of the people very very well
01:55:34.199 while young he ignores this talent
01:55:36.760 instead choosing violence to make his
01:55:38.880 way in the world he chooses to steal
01:55:41.800 from those weaker than
01:55:44.119 him he is armed when he robs and he
01:55:47.480 settles on a weapon of choice the fists
01:55:50.599 of big bogot he calls them and they
01:55:53.920 shatter bones with
01:55:56.239 ease he sees weakness as an excuse for
01:55:59.679 his crimes as if he is simply teaching
01:56:02.079 the weaker lesson they need to learn but
01:56:05.000 ain't my fault she's stupid enough to
01:56:06.880 get duped is it look as she ain't died
01:56:10.159 on the bloody roadside I reckon during
01:56:13.239 this time he had yet to be forced into a
01:56:15.360 prisoner's mask people might have called
01:56:18.440 him
01:56:19.320 beautiful but his soul had become
01:56:23.159 the soul of a blackard a thug he hangs
01:56:27.400 out with those he trusts and shares his
01:56:29.960 taste for prawns however some of his
01:56:32.599 friends may not be a good influence and
01:56:35.199 he ends up being locked up with one the
01:56:38.520 degree of punishment as well as who he
01:56:40.719 is locked up with make it likely that
01:56:43.119 they committed serious crimes bogot is
01:56:46.040 made to wear an Iron Mask a mask forced
01:56:49.320 on convicted prisoners another similar
01:56:52.320 mask in game is used for the same
01:56:54.199 purpose but has an even cruler design it
01:56:57.520 is used on prisoners convicted of an
01:57:00.000 appalling crime and is a foul creation
01:57:03.960 designed to torment the wearer either
01:57:06.159 slowly fermenting hatred within their
01:57:08.440 heart or a spiritual fervor that is near
01:57:11.800 indistinguishable from it bogot has more
01:57:15.040 space to breathe and see in his but it
01:57:17.880 must at first be claustrophobic and
01:57:20.599 panic inducing if blocks out much of the
01:57:23.440 world's light his freedom to breathe
01:57:26.320 reduced he is
01:57:28.679 dehumanized even if his soul was already
01:57:31.320 warped before it warps further during
01:57:35.880 captivity this is only the beginning
01:57:39.119 whether he deserves it or not bot's time
01:57:41.760 in jail is
01:57:43.719 horrific his friend his soulmate doesn't
01:57:47.400 last long bot's one Comfort his friend
01:57:51.400 becomes a former when they are joined by
01:57:54.440 another I was in the same jail as him
01:57:56.920 once the dung eater does something
01:57:59.719 terrible while in jail does something
01:58:02.560 that to this day Boger cannot
01:58:06.400 forget I ain't seen nothing more
01:58:08.760 disgusting in all my years I ever been
01:58:11.840 more scared neither rooted to the bloody
01:58:15.400 Spot while he did that to my friend
01:58:22.760 bogur has to witness the Twisted dung
01:58:25.360 eater kill and curse his friend the
01:58:29.440 gruesome technique combining Omen horns
01:58:32.440 and filthy heresy will haunt bogot
01:58:36.320 forever do the jailers come to remove
01:58:38.920 the dung eater from bogut's cell or does
01:58:41.679 the dung eater decide it's not bogut's
01:58:44.079 time in any case bogot lives to tell the
01:58:47.520 tale and eventually his time in prison
01:58:51.480 comes to an
01:58:53.320 end is bogot released from jail or does
01:58:57.000 he escape he leaves with his prisoner's
01:58:59.719 mask still on which would be cruel if he
01:59:02.560 had finished his sentence whatever the
01:59:05.119 case may be bogot chooses to keep the
01:59:07.719 mask on to this
01:59:11.480 day on release he has no real remorse
01:59:14.960 for his crimes and turns to violence
01:59:17.760 once
01:59:19.520 more and The Mask helps him to bogot The
01:59:23.480 Mask made him all the more threatening
01:59:26.000 and helped him get what he wanted the
01:59:28.800 threat of the Mask is like a bluff and
01:59:31.239 it means bogot doesn't have to fight to
01:59:33.480 get what he wants we originally thought
01:59:36.199 bot's name blackard big bogot meant a
01:59:39.360 bluffer to BL means to manage to obtain
01:59:43.119 something by using persuasion or guile
01:59:46.599 to obtain with persuasion or guile seems
01:59:49.320 like bluffing but this is not what his
01:59:51.639 name means means blackard means a man
01:59:54.599 who behaves in a dishonorable or
01:59:56.800 contempt way this fits with what we know
01:59:59.719 of him so far but this is his reputation
02:00:03.840 he doesn't call himself a blackard what
02:00:06.880 he does call himself is big
02:00:09.760 bogot bogot is defined as an evil or
02:00:13.599 mischievous Spirit was he given this
02:00:16.400 name from birth was his soul evil from
02:00:19.440 the beginning or is this a form of self
02:00:22.239 loathing and acceptance of how others
02:00:25.159 perceive him until well after being free
02:00:28.239 from prison his behavior deserves his
02:00:31.560 reputation but after some time for some
02:00:35.239 unknown reason bogot decides to
02:00:40.679 change his helmet states that while it
02:00:43.360 helped him get what he wanted it was
02:00:45.960 also a mirror of his emptiness it is as
02:00:49.760 though his way of life intimidate
02:00:52.719 violence dishonor is having an effect on
02:00:55.679 his soul on his inner order that is too
02:00:59.040 hard to bear on meeting no one fails to
02:01:02.599 notice that he doesn't like himself or
02:01:05.800 believe in
02:01:07.000 himself makes no bloody sense anyway I
02:01:09.960 so no name like me should get called to
02:01:12.679 the lands
02:01:13.679 between not just some petty th like
02:01:17.199 me it serves me right fitting bloody end
02:01:25.040 for the weight of this self-loathing may
02:01:28.560 have become too much to bear and whether
02:01:31.960 he knows it or not bogot starts to act
02:01:35.040 in a way that he can be more proud of so
02:01:38.280 that he can like
02:01:41.040 himself bogot decides that he wants to
02:01:43.800 bring value to the world and so the
02:01:47.480 blackard begins a New
02:01:50.480 Journey at some some point he sees Grace
02:01:54.079 as though it was the path to a better
02:01:56.040 life he hardly even believes in
02:01:59.079 Grace makes no bloody sense anyway my
02:02:02.679 son no name like me should get called to
02:02:05.400 the lands
02:02:06.480 between and yet he follows its
02:02:14.159 path bogot follows his intuition and
02:02:17.679 after arriving in the lands between sets
02:02:20.880 up a prawn shop and he tries hard he
02:02:25.199 works at it long enough for a Point of
02:02:27.400 Grace to be named after his store he has
02:02:30.280 likely built the shack himself and
02:02:32.520 stacked wood for burning beside it his
02:02:35.960 natural talent for prawn cooking from
02:02:38.000 his earlier life now turns professional
02:02:41.400 and he becomes a true prawn connoisseur
02:02:45.199 he avoids over
02:02:47.239 salting his intuition tells him that
02:02:49.960 something delicious and that boosts
02:02:52.320 defense will be in high demand in the
02:02:54.560 lands
02:02:55.760 between he may be on to
02:02:59.520 something as he begins to go on the
02:03:01.840 straight and narrow he struggles to quit
02:03:04.480 his bad habits he is still aggressive he
02:03:08.239 is still rude he still likes Loot and he
02:03:12.480 will always love chests he likes bird
02:03:16.880 watching shall we say his favorite part
02:03:19.599 of the chicken isn't the drumstick
02:03:22.520 he likes to keep a breast of current
02:03:24.840 affairs if you will if we may be so bold
02:03:28.840 he eats his meals with a glass of okay
02:03:32.520 enough Boger is still dishonest when we
02:03:35.639 meet him he sells crayfish and calls it
02:03:38.840 prawn but all of this is much better
02:03:41.880 than he used to be and like the mask he
02:03:44.840 wears a lot of his behavior is a front
02:03:48.320 because bogot more than anything is scar
02:03:52.639 he is scared of the big bad world and
02:03:55.679 everything in it he's scared to come out
02:03:58.480 of his mask what was once captivity has
02:04:02.079 become Comfort others see the mask and
02:04:05.320 flee from him thinking he is more
02:04:07.320 dangerous than he is he calls himself
02:04:10.400 big bogot but he isn't so big and
02:04:14.079 nowadays he isn't all that evil his
02:04:17.520 aggression is a bluff and we discover
02:04:20.199 this when we push through it
02:04:22.440 we meet bogot at a lull in his journey
02:04:25.719 he no longer sees Grace his shop is
02:04:28.800 doing the rounds he is yet to truly
02:04:31.800 change his ways and others may take
02:04:34.960 advantage of his old habits dying hard
02:04:38.920 Rya needs to test those who may be
02:04:41.360 suitable for the volcano Mana she does
02:04:44.079 this by seeing if they will kill a
02:04:45.920 tarnished one of their own kind he too
02:04:50.239 is tarnished if you've any quals
02:04:53.520 confronting your own I shall find
02:04:57.079 another by some coincidence bogot a
02:05:01.159 tarnished steals R's necklace what a
02:05:05.159 coincidence too that patches a member of
02:05:08.360 the volcano Mana also hints that we need
02:05:10.920 to help
02:05:12.079 Rya by the way uh have you met that girl
02:05:15.040 Rya she's a strange one but I believe
02:05:17.960 she was in need of help not that it's
02:05:20.520 any of my business is but if she Rings
02:05:23.800 your bell why not lend her an ear an odd
02:05:27.040 thing for the self-serving patches to do
02:05:30.679 Boger himself when we accuse him of
02:05:32.920 stealing the necklace says s the
02:05:35.679 particulars of the matter while he
02:05:37.760 doesn't deny it entirely we believe he
02:05:40.320 gave in to his old bad habits in what
02:05:43.400 was a classic honey pot she wanted him
02:05:46.559 to commit the crime and tempted
02:05:50.159 him what we can can say is whatever
02:05:53.000 truly went down bogot did not use
02:05:56.000 violence the old bogot certainly would
02:05:59.040 have we are left to speculate on the
02:06:02.119 rest do you think bogot was
02:06:04.840 tricked it is here that bogot once again
02:06:07.840 shows his remarkable intuition anyway
02:06:11.719 she ain't all right that one looky she
02:06:13.679 ain't died on the bloody roadside I
02:06:15.480 reckon and he is
02:06:17.800 correct his intuition extends to the
02:06:20.840 Earth tree and to the golden order
02:06:23.760 itself maybe something went with it
02:06:26.880 maybe it's been broke for a good long
02:06:28.760 time the urum saying his intuition is
02:06:33.360 better than half the members of the
02:06:35.119 golden order
02:06:37.719 together perhaps bot's magical intuition
02:06:41.119 is leading him on a bigger path than
02:06:43.520 even he
02:06:46.400 realizes but at the boil prawn Shack he
02:06:49.960 needed someone to shake him out of his
02:06:52.800 stagnation and we can be that someone if
02:06:56.840 we push through his aggression and
02:06:58.719 choose to buy his prawn he starts to let
02:07:01.679 down his defenses he stops bluffing and
02:07:05.320 he starts to trust us never met someone
02:07:08.880 with a taste for Brer couldn't trust
02:07:11.280 we'd make good mates a
02:07:12.760 reckon a theme in Elden ring is how a
02:07:15.960 person or group is treated is how they
02:07:18.719 will treat you give him some kindness
02:07:21.840 and he'll call you his mate he gives us
02:07:25.520 a gesture is it the gesture of giving up
02:07:29.960 or is it just what is needed after a
02:07:33.119 belly full of
02:07:35.079 prawn as the relationship grows he
02:07:37.920 starts being more hopeful about the
02:07:39.760 future you've got a real thing here e
02:07:42.880 and it's only getting better our
02:07:44.960 friendship seems to animate him does he
02:07:47.880 see grace again after we meet him or is
02:07:50.840 his next action his own idea because big
02:07:54.599 bogot packs up shop and travels to
02:07:57.639 Leander and he travels the hard way he
02:08:00.880 battles the magma worm with his fists
02:08:03.719 and Roars the creature
02:08:08.800 down he can even be summoned to help us
02:08:12.159 his mate he uses his own product because
02:08:16.280 he really believes in what he
02:08:19.040 sells he sets up on the outskirt of
02:08:21.840 landelle where the crabs are plentiful
02:08:24.320 and the demand for boosting defense is
02:08:27.559 much
02:08:28.960 higher he does all of this alone once he
02:08:33.400 sets up by landelle he keeps things lean
02:08:36.800 he has yet to build a shack but he
02:08:38.559 strives once more to improve he now
02:08:41.599 serves real crap and this time bogot is
02:08:45.119 totally honest about the produce he even
02:08:48.079 sells crab at the same price as the
02:08:50.559 crayfish despite it arguably warranting
02:08:53.480 a Higher One Small crayfish are not
02:08:56.199 protected by the large ones but this is
02:08:59.040 not true of crabs the large and the
02:09:02.000 small roam together in addition to the
02:09:05.119 added danger crab gives a higher boost
02:09:07.719 to our defense than prawn so bogot is
02:09:11.239 giving us exceptional value by not
02:09:13.639 selling the crab at an increased fee
02:09:16.679 honestly it's one of the best
02:09:18.559 consumables in the
02:09:20.360 game when we find him here he doesn't
02:09:23.719 recognize us at first this allows us by
02:09:27.639 chance to see that his aggression is an
02:09:30.679 act what are you looking at oh you again
02:09:35.079 is he perfect Bloody time actually I got
02:09:38.800 crab cooked up
02:09:41.119 fresh because he is afraid because he
02:09:44.119 needs to protect himself he is
02:09:46.800 aggressive but once he recognizes us he
02:09:50.000 becomes our friend again
02:09:52.040 he trusts us a fellow fighter a fellow
02:09:55.760 tarnished we need crab to boost our
02:09:58.400 defense because we are the downtrodden
02:10:01.840 the two of us are the smallest of
02:10:03.679 players in this world and mates look out
02:10:07.040 for each
02:10:08.440 other but by accident we end bot's
02:10:13.960 Journey bogot has been discarding the
02:10:16.719 ghosts of his past anger loathing empty
02:10:21.639 us but one ghost is much more physical
02:10:26.239 and we release
02:10:28.520 him just as he conquers his inner demons
02:10:32.400 and outer demon joins the
02:10:36.480 fry bogot notices his old cellmate
02:10:39.719 presence in the capital outskirts and he
02:10:42.760 looks out for us taking the time to warn
02:10:46.199 us yeah they're now seen it here again
02:10:49.960 never thought I would
02:10:52.040 it was it was him no question that
02:10:57.000 monster he's lurking around eh he wants
02:11:01.000 us to stay safe we are
02:11:04.440 lucky but the dung eater finds bogot who
02:11:09.079 becomes his next
02:11:14.520 victim God damn
02:11:17.360 it why ain't it me
02:11:21.360 why ain't it
02:11:23.440 ever we find bogot on the point of death
02:11:28.159 he begs for release from the dung
02:11:30.599 eater's
02:11:31.719 torture and in his last moments he loses
02:11:35.920 faith in himself and his
02:11:39.320 Ambitions it serves me right fitting
02:11:42.599 bloody end for a jump up L with Big
02:11:48.400 Ideas help me out would you me I don't
02:11:52.400 want to get cursed just let me
02:11:56.000 die I don't want to live like this it's
02:11:59.559 not
02:12:00.480 anymore
02:12:02.239 so
02:12:06.760 please but before we can grant him his
02:12:09.400 wish and perhaps prevent him from being
02:12:12.280 cursed he
02:12:14.079 dies on death he only drops 100 runes he
02:12:19.440 must have put everything back into his
02:12:22.280 business if we had managed to Grant him
02:12:25.320 Mercy would this have allowed bogot Soul
02:12:28.520 hopefully now a purer soul to return to
02:12:31.719 the Earth tree let us hope that the dung
02:12:34.679 eater hadn't completed the cursing
02:12:37.159 process so that he can be born again
02:12:41.000 this time a little more blessed not only
02:12:44.360 for everyone to enjoy his connoisseur
02:12:46.520 prawn his crab and his humor but because
02:12:50.199 his intuition had him on a unique path
02:12:53.920 that may have made him a healing force
02:12:56.599 in the lands
02:12:58.159 between for a jum up little with big
02:13:02.760 ideas just what were his big ideas did
02:13:06.760 he even know how consequential they
02:13:08.920 might be because bot might just have
02:13:12.520 been an accidental
02:13:14.800 genius the crab and prawn meat is not
02:13:18.239 only healthy and nutritious it is a
02:13:21.199 abundant and cheap the rich obsess about
02:13:24.760 the flavor of crab eggs perhaps
02:13:27.159 suggesting that they look down upon more
02:13:29.280 mature crab meat and if so this would
02:13:33.079 most likely be because of where the
02:13:35.159 creatures live the crayfish and crab
02:13:38.480 crowd around waste water around filth
02:13:43.000 around death and they are there eating
02:13:47.760 they eat these impurities that is why
02:13:50.760 they are are so abundant because the
02:13:52.800 world is filling up with this waste
02:13:55.079 because of the fractures and errors in
02:13:57.320 the current order has bot's intuition
02:14:00.679 made another remarkable leap the rich
02:14:04.239 should look closer the state of the
02:14:06.960 world's impurities can be seen in some
02:14:09.559 crabs there are even some who are
02:14:12.320 infused with death blight where this
02:14:15.360 curse can be seen on the crab's external
02:14:17.880 shell the dead inanimate shell
02:14:22.159 death blight is rampant rapidly
02:14:24.599 infecting the world including these
02:14:27.159 Bottom Feeders and yet the meat they
02:14:31.079 drop is clean all the drops are clean
02:14:35.679 healthy white meat no matter where they
02:14:38.760 live or what diet they have the crabs
02:14:42.119 are miraculous creatures that can filter
02:14:44.559 out any impurities including disease
02:14:48.159 death and sickness and use it to grow
02:14:51.520 strong not only is bot's food cheap
02:14:55.000 abundant and very nutritious but it is
02:14:58.079 in harmony with nature in an intuitive
02:15:01.760 way bogot is solving the problem his
02:15:05.280 business expanded enough done long
02:15:08.280 enough May mend the lands between bogot
02:15:12.440 the intuitive version of gold mask
02:15:15.119 follows a path of Simplicity and Strikes
02:15:19.440 gold but before he could uncover its
02:15:22.119 true potential he was cut down taking
02:15:25.440 his skills with him let us hope in his
02:15:29.199 next life he is not judged too soon in
02:15:33.360 the credits for the game he is listed
02:15:35.520 only as Thug Born Into the world with
02:15:39.400 such a label what chance did he
02:15:43.199 have but given a chance who knows what
02:15:46.840 he might
02:15:48.000 achieve bogot is one of the only people
02:15:51.040 in the lands between who becomes more
02:15:53.400 likable and more trustworthy the more we
02:15:56.360 know about him perhaps in his next life
02:15:59.960 he will not be a big bogot a big evil
02:16:03.679 spirit but simply big spirited because
02:16:07.760 next time we know our prawn brother is
02:16:10.239 going to make it and when he does let's
02:16:14.199 hope we can be there to have a drink
02:16:16.480 with him over some salted
02:16:19.119 prawns you've got a real thing thing
02:16:21.880 here and it's only getting
02:16:32.599 better here was the secret of Happiness
02:16:36.000 about which philosophers had disputed
02:16:38.478 happiness might now be bought for a
02:16:40.080 penny and carried in the waste coat
02:16:42.200 pocket portable ecstasies might be had
02:16:45.398 corked up in a pint
02:16:47.679 bottle the power to alter body and mind
02:16:50.439 with the Gifts of nature is like nothing
02:16:52.718 else if power can corrupt Lords and gods
02:16:56.558 then the power held by healers has its
02:16:58.439 own Temptations everyone in positions of
02:17:01.599 trust and influence in the lands between
02:17:03.760 will have their own particular vices the
02:17:06.519 history of the perfumers is a history of
02:17:08.679 healers who cannot swear to have done no
02:17:12.080 harm the perfumer power is the ability
02:17:15.200 to influence the mind and the body but
02:17:17.840 not only of their patients there are
02:17:20.478 side effects to the craft both on
02:17:22.799 patient and perfumer perfuming is an
02:17:25.920 age-old practice in the lands between
02:17:28.280 its influence has dispersed to many
02:17:30.040 cultures throughout Elden ring more than
02:17:32.398 we can know we will share here what we
02:17:35.398 have discovered about perfumers some who
02:17:38.080 profess to do good some who descend to
02:17:40.920 depravity and some who commit such
02:17:43.558 violence that their own emotions need to
02:17:45.879 be silenced farewell to smiles and
02:17:49.280 laughter farewell to Peace of Mind
02:17:52.120 farewell to Hope and to tranquil dreams
02:17:55.240 and to the Blessed consolations of
02:17:59.318 sleep the history of perfumers in our
02:18:01.840 own world is not a spotless one nature
02:18:04.638 creates the purest ingredients and to
02:18:06.840 make an exceptional perfume you must
02:18:08.638 draw from nature these ingredients
02:18:10.920 cannot be obtained by someone with an
02:18:12.879 overactive conscience some more
02:18:15.200 well-known animals that were slaughtered
02:18:16.840 in history for the sake of perfumes were
02:18:19.040 deer and whales but the victims are many
02:18:22.160 and diverse these living breathing
02:18:25.080 products fell victim to a soaring market
02:18:27.519 price once their scent potential was
02:18:29.558 discovered and a single gland or duct
02:18:32.200 was worth killing the whole Beast for
02:18:35.000 without other alternatives to meet
02:18:36.760 market demand greed is always the rule
02:18:39.959 and as always in a from software game if
02:18:42.318 The Inspirations in the real world are
02:18:44.359 dark then we should be ready to descend
02:18:46.879 much deeper into human
02:18:49.318 Darkness let us discover the depths of
02:18:52.519 the
02:18:54.040 perfumers in the world of Elden ring
02:18:56.679 perfumers come to exist quite early so
02:18:59.478 to do Miranda flowers who emerge even
02:19:02.120 earlier than perfumers we know both of
02:19:04.799 these facts thanks to the description of
02:19:06.760 one item Miranda powder throughout human
02:19:10.200 history perfumers have prized this
02:19:13.558 pollen perfumers Miranda flowers and
02:19:16.920 inevitably trade around this ingredient
02:19:19.599 has existed in the world almost since
02:19:21.519 records began for this age whether this
02:19:24.080 is after the war against the Giants from
02:19:26.478 which the new rulers started its own
02:19:28.359 history all perfumers emerged even
02:19:30.760 before that date is unknown there is no
02:19:33.679 evidence of perfumers fighting in the
02:19:35.519 giant War but we cannot be sure this
02:19:38.959 daating shows that trade around perfumes
02:19:41.718 and the ingredients that make them is
02:19:43.558 very basic to the lands between even if
02:19:46.359 the secrets of the craft are not widely
02:19:48.840 dispersed
02:19:50.880 the beginnings of perfuming likely
02:19:52.760 begins naturally starting with
02:19:54.840 accidental discoveries in
02:19:57.000 nature with simple blind luck and a bit
02:20:00.000 of risky experimentation just as in our
02:20:02.439 own ancient civilizations many
02:20:04.800 discoveries are made over
02:20:07.240 time the effects of pollen resin fruits
02:20:11.920 roots or any other gifts of nature
02:20:14.160 cannot help but be stumbled upon
02:20:16.080 eventually even animals get drunk by
02:20:18.680 mistake and most poisons or Delights of
02:20:21.439 nature are intended to be stumbled upon
02:20:23.600 by the plants or animals who made them
02:20:25.880 they are designed for effect the effect
02:20:28.520 of Miranda pollen on humans may be
02:20:30.560 pleasant before perfumers work with it
02:20:33.200 because the Miranda flower needs to
02:20:34.880 tempt its prey within Striking
02:20:37.120 Distance the discoveries in Elden ring
02:20:39.439 are different to our world scent in
02:20:41.520 Elden ring can have a much more powerful
02:20:43.880 effect on the mind and body we shouldn't
02:20:46.600 assume the senses are as limited as in
02:20:49.000 our world once the the effects of these
02:20:51.280 scents are discovered these unique
02:20:53.439 natural ingredients are so powerful that
02:20:56.080 they can either heal or harm to use them
02:20:59.439 on oneself or others can immediately
02:21:02.240 make you a Healer an Entertainer a
02:21:06.080 Tormentor an Illusionist or a dream
02:21:09.840 Creator so Begins the culture of the
02:21:12.880 perfumers though from these simple
02:21:15.160 Beginnings we can already smell the
02:21:17.280 seeds of moral rot one craping for is
02:21:20.920 the ingredient that from earliest
02:21:22.560 history to the present day perfumers
02:21:24.880 cannot deny themselves Miranda flour
02:21:28.080 pollen their most essential ingredient
02:21:31.640 it has always commanded a price and
02:21:33.920 perfumers have always paid it but the
02:21:36.720 cost to produce is stated clearly in the
02:21:39.200 item description the plant is a man
02:21:42.120 eating Miranda flower and the Miranda
02:21:44.840 flowers Ash's item description leaves no
02:21:47.240 doubt spirits of sweet little Miranda
02:21:49.920 flowers carnivorous blossoms that feed
02:21:52.600 upon human flesh this means that
02:21:55.560 perfumers must harm in the first step of
02:21:58.040 their healing process the other
02:22:00.319 corrupting aspect is the sheer potency
02:22:02.800 of the craft a perfumer in a position of
02:22:05.600 trust has such power over others over
02:22:08.280 their body and mind that anyone would be
02:22:11.000 tempted not to mention in a sea of
02:22:13.600 Supply the thought must arise to
02:22:15.800 influence one's own mind these
02:22:18.760 unavoidable Temptations will always
02:22:20.920 stalk the perfumers and many will not be
02:22:23.720 able to
02:22:24.840 resist Miranda flowers themselves
02:22:27.439 deserve to be discussed these flowers
02:22:30.120 are referred to in item descriptions and
02:22:32.720 Ashes as though they are sentient the
02:22:35.160 item descriptions are sarcastic about
02:22:37.120 the Miranda flowers calling them sweet
02:22:39.840 and Little Darlings but we doubt this
02:22:42.280 sarcasm applies to whether the Miranda
02:22:44.160 flowers are conscious they can move and
02:22:46.920 react to us if we are aggressive towards
02:22:49.040 them they seem to have a relationship
02:22:51.280 with the various sects of perfumers
02:22:53.920 staying non-aggressive even with close
02:22:56.240 contact and likely while perfumers
02:22:58.720 Harvest some of their pollen given their
02:23:01.600 diet requirements it is likely to be a
02:23:03.880 symbiotic relationship and the flowers
02:23:06.160 can understand not to bite the hand that
02:23:08.560 feeds them it is also probable that
02:23:11.120 their pollen is so potent precisely
02:23:13.680 because they have aspects of humanity
02:23:15.600 within them csing through them not only
02:23:18.720 do Miranda flowers feed on flashh they
02:23:21.560 may have a human origin a cut content
02:23:24.680 item describes who may be the first of
02:23:27.040 the species Miranda maiden of the flower
02:23:30.160 Crucible is said to have been the very
02:23:32.439 first of this breed in game they are
02:23:35.399 called Miranda flowers which is a human
02:23:38.160 name it is also a name beginning with m
02:23:41.439 which is similar to Melania and ment
02:23:44.680 hugar states can bloom to what if any
02:23:48.880 extent there is some genetic or or
02:23:50.680 environmental crossover between these
02:23:52.520 women and Miranda flowers is a mystery
02:23:55.120 for now but there is some core Humanity
02:23:58.120 in Miranda flowers and indeed one flower
02:24:01.080 is literally called Miranda we find her
02:24:04.160 so close to the other boss in the room
02:24:06.040 that they could almost be talking and
02:24:08.439 yet she does not aggress to him if there
02:24:10.960 is some core Humanity before this
02:24:12.760 transformation to flowers it would
02:24:14.600 likely make the pollen all the more
02:24:16.640 effective on
02:24:18.800 humans the in ation of perfuming comes
02:24:22.240 from nature first the essential plants
02:24:25.200 and Gardens exist in the wild well
02:24:27.800 before heavy cultivation or a community
02:24:30.520 and culture around perfumes develops
02:24:33.399 even today the Traveler's robe says that
02:24:35.640 this traveling perfumer was searching
02:24:37.399 for new Gardens in the wild with new
02:24:40.080 plants it is natural to find pockets of
02:24:42.880 certain plants in nature and at first it
02:24:45.399 will have been wild foraging that fed
02:24:47.439 the craft harvesting these lucky pockets
02:24:50.439 of abundance and occasionally natural
02:24:53.040 Gardens gives the perfumers their start
02:24:56.520 if the forefathers of perfuming are not
02:24:58.920 in lendelle or the city that may have
02:25:01.319 been lendelle before the UR tree the
02:25:03.520 capital city makes sure to have all the
02:25:05.720 perfumers under its roof before the
02:25:08.000 craft spreads elsewhere as with every
02:25:10.800 craft a lot of experimentation begins in
02:25:13.120 these early stages with time a whole
02:25:16.040 range of ingredients are found to be
02:25:17.760 useful everything from glowing m to
02:25:20.800 formic Rock many more are surely yet to
02:25:23.800 be discovered even today unfortunately
02:25:26.880 many that are found to be useful are
02:25:28.960 also dangerous to find or toxic to
02:25:31.680 handle this immediately makes their
02:25:34.040 supply difficult and their purchase
02:25:37.120 expensive soon a simple solution is
02:25:39.880 found and perfumers start cultivating
02:25:42.240 their own Gardens where they can grow
02:25:44.399 their own supply of ingredients this
02:25:46.760 cuts out the complexity of sourcing
02:25:48.840 themselves or the cost of middle
02:25:51.240 man the value of the ingredients is
02:25:54.040 still so high and the process of growing
02:25:56.520 the plant still so morally unpleasant
02:25:59.560 that they build and grow these Gardens
02:26:01.479 in secret protected from theft and the
02:26:04.279 Judgment of the public whether hidden on
02:26:07.520 the fringes of the highlands or obscured
02:26:10.040 by Shadows inside caves the flowers
02:26:12.680 blossom in secret waiting to impart
02:26:15.560 their
02:26:16.600 scent of course the perfumers can't grow
02:26:19.520 everything however and there will be a
02:26:21.520 market for selling certain risky or
02:26:23.720 hard-to find ingredients to perfumers
02:26:26.319 even with their own Gardens products
02:26:28.160 which can influence the mind will always
02:26:30.200 have demand which outstrips Supply so a
02:26:33.040 Commerce continues to rise around
02:26:35.120 perfumers and perfuming with ingredients
02:26:38.319 coming from as far as the Eternal City
02:26:40.880 and the anel this diversity of Supply
02:26:43.960 gives the perfumers the interactions and
02:26:46.200 connections to influence and be
02:26:48.479 influenced to learn from
02:26:50.760 teach and be
02:26:53.319 corrupted the capital seeks to jealously
02:26:56.080 guard the craft of the perfumers the
02:26:58.520 first reason is because of its immense
02:27:00.840 power well beyond mere healing it is not
02:27:04.200 simply as in the eyes of the many a
02:27:06.680 blessed Apothecary this fortunate
02:27:09.279 opinion of the public gives the
02:27:10.760 impression of something mild but a means
02:27:13.840 of changing the mind the emotions
02:27:16.840 altering the lens with which a person or
02:27:19.160 people see the world
02:27:20.680 such a power ought to be guarded it
02:27:23.200 might even be useful to have the general
02:27:25.359 public perceive it as simply another
02:27:27.600 form of healing what it is believed to
02:27:30.359 be truly is and might become are all
02:27:34.399 different the other reason for this
02:27:36.359 jealousy is because of the natural
02:27:38.399 interconnectedness when a craft needs
02:27:40.319 ingredients from across the land you
02:27:42.600 don't have to be overprotective of what
02:27:44.560 is locked in a basement but the
02:27:46.439 perfumers need to acquire products from
02:27:48.520 many different corners of the world and
02:27:50.640 landelle doesn't want this power seeded
02:27:53.240 elsewhere one ingredient that perfectly
02:27:55.920 illustrates the risk is a silver tier
02:27:58.160 husk used even today in lendelle perfume
02:28:01.600 inventions which meant contact with a
02:28:04.160 city that eventually committed
02:28:07.240 heresy some steps the capital takes are
02:28:10.160 very common steps for a society wishing
02:28:12.319 to maintain
02:28:13.800 loyalty as well as keeping costs low the
02:28:16.800 cultivation of ingredients as close as
02:28:18.880 possible to the capital will stop those
02:28:21.000 trying to tempt perfumers away with
02:28:23.319 offers The perfumer Grotto a prime
02:28:26.319 example of a perfumer run cultivation
02:28:29.040 sits just outside the capital walls at
02:28:32.000 the closest possible point to the
02:28:33.760 capital where such wild and dangerous
02:28:36.279 plants can be grown the capital also
02:28:39.080 makes sure that the path of becoming a
02:28:41.040 perfumer is one that takes a lot of
02:28:43.359 sunken cost it doesn't allow a perfumer
02:28:46.399 to be accredited to earn the respect
02:28:49.240 until they have reached a very high
02:28:50.840 level of training a long commitment to
02:28:53.359 achieve a license is always a sunken
02:28:55.880 cost and what takes time to earn is hard
02:28:58.880 to give up a position of respect in
02:29:01.680 society the anchor of responsibility and
02:29:04.960 pride a reliable craft to earn their way
02:29:08.359 a feeling of doing good all of this will
02:29:11.520 prevent perfumers from straying for the
02:29:14.080 most part their outfits signify their
02:29:16.840 Duty and their allegiance the UR Trey is
02:29:20.359 proudly displayed on their apron the
02:29:22.680 weight of the robe and even the chains
02:29:24.760 upon it remind them of their
02:29:27.120 responsibility to say goodbye to the
02:29:29.479 center of perfumer learning and all of
02:29:31.960 the social benefits of the capital
02:29:33.920 wouldn't be a common thought and if you
02:29:36.399 considered it you would be risking the
02:29:38.200 Wrath of the most powerful faction in
02:29:40.560 the world most of the perfumers would
02:29:43.120 stay loyal as the culture and craft of
02:29:46.560 the perfumers develops over time long
02:29:49.359 periods of time time it becomes
02:29:51.279 incomparably richer and deeper the
02:29:54.439 evidence is all around the capital whole
02:29:57.160 rooms are devoted to perfumer work
02:30:00.000 mountains of books and
02:30:05.439 Scrolls complex plant
02:30:12.800 cultivation custommade bottles and
02:30:15.399 diffusers
02:30:22.520 the role of perfumer has progressed to
02:30:25.000 one that has a depth which taken far
02:30:27.319 enough truly makes a master bottles have
02:30:30.680 been made likely of an extremely complex
02:30:33.479 design to operate the mixing and timing
02:30:36.880 the container may be what allows the
02:30:38.800 Nuance of a perfume's creation like the
02:30:41.640 delicate crafting of a firework how it
02:30:44.200 releases itself over time is likely how
02:30:47.040 the effect is achieved as we traveled
02:30:49.640 the land between we cannot make a
02:30:51.640 perfuma concoction without these
02:30:53.800 essential bottles such is the level of
02:30:56.720 even this small aspect of the
02:30:59.279 craft the healers at this point work
02:31:01.840 with both body and mind some to such a
02:31:04.840 level that they become renowned for the
02:31:07.560 most part these Masters play their roles
02:31:09.960 in society as is expected of them and
02:31:12.960 the perfumers enjoy a stable period of
02:31:15.960 history but at some point this piece is
02:31:19.920 troubled by the arrival of a new type of
02:31:22.200 creature in the world
02:31:25.279 Omens Omens are human or born to humans
02:31:29.359 but they appear monstrous horned and
02:31:32.319 brutish they are viewed as cursed and
02:31:35.160 unclean by the Society of leandel and
02:31:38.040 the lands between a newborn of any
02:31:40.760 social class can suffer be they Royal or
02:31:43.600 commoner and both do suffer please don't
02:31:47.319 hate me or curse me a common ooman child
02:31:51.680 has its horns amputated with most dying
02:31:54.560 in the process if they survive they may
02:31:57.399 be used for their brute strength as
02:31:59.240 adults Royals keep their horns avoiding
02:32:02.359 the operation and so most survive they
02:32:05.560 are allowed to live but it is not a good
02:32:08.000 life they are locked up and hidden away
02:32:10.560 deep below the capital for the rest of
02:32:12.399 their days some special Royals even have
02:32:15.359 magic seals made binding them to the
02:32:17.760 very ground of course we can presume
02:32:21.160 that for the first Omens and certainly
02:32:23.720 for the first Royal Omens no system was
02:32:26.479 in place it was a totally new thing to
02:32:29.279 have mothers giving birth to Omens Who
02:32:31.479 would know what to do the first Royal
02:32:34.319 Omen to be born wouldn't have been
02:32:36.120 locked away after all a mother wouldn't
02:32:38.760 give up so fast even of an omen the
02:32:42.240 prattling Pate your beautiful aply
02:32:45.040 describes a mother's emotions
02:32:47.279 unconditional love unrestrained
02:32:50.279 Assurance a mother would want the omen
02:32:52.840 healed and who are the healers to the
02:32:55.160 Royals of Lal the
02:32:57.680 perfumers to this very day some
02:33:00.399 perfumers go on to seek a cure the
02:33:03.240 healing would have been attempted using
02:33:05.800 every bit of Ingenuity the perfumers
02:33:08.279 possessed but it failed Omens seemed and
02:33:12.640 still seem to be
02:33:14.920 incurable so began the amputation and
02:33:18.359 imprisonment of the
02:33:20.359 respective to social class A simple
02:33:23.520 expedient solution the emergence of
02:33:26.240 Omens in history was a long time ago we
02:33:28.880 know they have been around since
02:33:30.359 Antiquity thanks to a certain famous
02:33:32.960 gentleman we will discuss in a
02:33:35.880 moment during this period of attempted
02:33:38.600 healing and in the time since the
02:33:41.120 perfumers got to know the Omens
02:33:43.479 amputating their horns allowed the
02:33:45.479 perfumers to learn the nature of the
02:33:47.479 horns influencing their minds allowed
02:33:50.279 them to learn their emotions sitting
02:33:52.760 beside them and communicating with them
02:33:55.399 allowed them to learn their dreams the
02:33:58.000 dagger Talisman States a sense of Mercy
02:34:01.160 is a catalyst for blood lust how
02:34:03.960 interesting that this item also refers
02:34:06.439 to healers in this case surgeons whose
02:34:09.000 roles warped into those who delivered
02:34:11.080 the merciful finishing Blow That Grew
02:34:13.560 blood lust within them the position of
02:34:16.439 healer is always a position of trust
02:34:19.720 needing to be healed means you are
02:34:21.520 inherently more vulnerable than when you
02:34:23.640 are healthy a sufferer will not show
02:34:26.120 weakness to an enemy if they can help it
02:34:28.880 they will not beg please don't hate me
02:34:31.840 or curse me they will not reveal their
02:34:34.800 sadness or the fear in their nightmares
02:34:38.479 but to a
02:34:39.840 Healer at some point the Omens did
02:34:42.560 reveal their fears the Deep fears of
02:34:45.479 their dream and one perfumer a master
02:34:48.680 Craftsman of the mind and emotions
02:34:51.479 decided to use this knowledge for a
02:34:53.200 whole new purpose by this point Omen
02:34:56.359 births had become more numerous if any
02:34:58.800 were born outside landal they may have
02:35:01.160 been beyond the possibility of early
02:35:03.120 amputation even those born within the
02:35:05.359 capital might keep their horns if a
02:35:07.560 mother kept the child secret or the
02:35:09.880 pregnancy secret from the beginning for
02:35:12.080 fear of the consequences if the child
02:35:14.160 was born Omen it would add to the mature
02:35:17.200 Omen numbers it was inevitable that
02:35:20.000 adult Omen would increase in the vast
02:35:22.200 lands of the world there needed to be an
02:35:24.680 additional solution Le andel's
02:35:26.880 amputations and prisons were not enough
02:35:29.680 so one perfumer stood up to try and
02:35:32.319 solve this problem the man to take the
02:35:35.040 first step in a new craft was called r r
02:35:39.840 had worked with emotions as a perfumer
02:35:41.920 for long enough to reach the highest
02:35:43.680 rank and Status he was a master but his
02:35:46.840 Renown extended Beyond his peers he he
02:35:49.720 was literally famous so r embarked on a
02:35:53.080 new task a new solution and he brought
02:35:56.920 all his learning and skill with him to
02:35:59.680 begin his task he needed to twist up his
02:36:02.200 conscience and silence his emotions
02:36:05.359 after a lifetime of changing emotions
02:36:08.120 strengthening them releasing them he now
02:36:11.640 attempts to delete them remarkably R
02:36:15.800 succeeds and then begins with total calm
02:36:19.600 to hunt Omens and kill them it would be
02:36:23.600 simple to think of r as a villain the
02:36:26.160 Omens are not chosen to be born as they
02:36:28.359 are and can be gentle even moral
02:36:31.160 characters who do what they believe is
02:36:32.920 right for Le andelle and the lands
02:36:34.600 between to hunt and slaughter them makes
02:36:37.319 Ros seem a twisted Soul who takes
02:36:39.680 pleasure in The Butchery and Mayhem of
02:36:42.240 his new craft except that he couldn't
02:36:45.840 have he couldn't feel any pleasure after
02:36:48.680 em bibing his physic so why start this
02:36:51.960 New Journey at all Omens themselves
02:36:55.120 might explain it it is obvious from many
02:36:57.600 items in dialogue that Omens are not all
02:37:00.439 monstrous they are sentient as
02:37:02.840 intelligent as any other characters in
02:37:04.720 the world kept underground away from
02:37:07.760 language culture and human interaction
02:37:10.840 anyone would be mute confused and
02:37:13.760 aggressive so they have been born and
02:37:16.279 dealt a very poor hand and the world for
02:37:19.160 the most most part believes them cursed
02:37:21.600 and unclean beings that may signify or
02:37:25.080 bring about a terrible future for the
02:37:27.720 land now while it is important to be
02:37:30.359 empathetic when trying to understand a
02:37:32.359 from software game what if this hate or
02:37:35.560 revulsion wasn't totally mistaken let's
02:37:38.800 look at the possibility that Omens are a
02:37:40.920 risk to the world or to the order of the
02:37:43.600 world as it is
02:37:45.880 now morgot is a character who wants to
02:37:48.920 protect the G tree and the Order of the
02:37:51.040 world everything he says and does seems
02:37:53.800 to fit this pattern and what about his
02:37:56.319 sword it states that morot recanted and
02:37:59.600 sealed away his cursed blood cursed here
02:38:03.200 isn't a quote or an opinion and morgot
02:38:06.240 himself did the sealing and recanting
02:38:09.359 during our fight with him at a certain
02:38:11.560 point we hurt him enough for his curse
02:38:14.080 to emerge he says the
02:38:18.000 Thrones stay Leed by my curse such shame
02:38:22.880 I cannot bear from the mouth of an omen
02:38:26.600 it is called a curse and he says he is
02:38:29.359 ashamed is this indoctrination or is
02:38:32.760 this simply that Omen blood and horns
02:38:35.279 are counter to or a risk to the UR Trey
02:38:38.600 and the current order every item
02:38:40.960 description that deals with Omen horns
02:38:43.000 calls them hideous and most frequently
02:38:45.960 loathsome once again these words are not
02:38:48.640 in quotes it doesn't seem to be an
02:38:51.000 opinion as though under the current
02:38:53.319 rules they are so just as something is
02:38:56.720 heavy or light in our world one Omen
02:39:00.040 boss the fell twins shows the Stark
02:39:02.720 difference of horns and what leaving
02:39:04.840 them on can allow to happen The Omen
02:39:07.439 with horns has Spirits emerging and
02:39:09.720 flying at us the amputated Omen merely
02:39:12.720 attacks with his axe perhaps what is
02:39:15.560 loathsome is the effect that can be
02:39:17.720 achieved with the horns and is therefore
02:39:19.960 to some extent inherent to the horns the
02:39:22.880 biggest sign that Omens may be a threat
02:39:24.640 to the balance of things is the seedbed
02:39:27.319 curse the dung eater manages to apply
02:39:30.399 this curse this man is no master
02:39:33.160 Craftsman and yet even him with just a
02:39:36.479 handful of omen horns can afflict
02:39:38.560 someone with a tender pox this pox is so
02:39:42.000 powerful that it prevents dead Souls
02:39:44.520 returning to the her tree leaving them
02:39:47.000 forever cursed so understanding Omens
02:39:50.760 fully is for another time but it seems
02:39:53.240 that things in the lands between are
02:39:55.000 complex it is unlikely that the
02:39:57.200 prejudice against Omens is based purely
02:39:59.800 on
02:40:01.160 looks Let Us return to R and look at his
02:40:04.439 choices in the light of Omens being a
02:40:06.640 real risk to the state of the world we
02:40:09.240 must remember R was a renowned perfumer
02:40:12.319 this status should give us a clue to the
02:40:14.560 type of choice the man made he has no
02:40:17.240 need to change his work for greater Fame
02:40:19.840 if he sought to commit depraved Acts or
02:40:22.200 enjoyed causing suffering he was already
02:40:24.560 in a position of trust with his patience
02:40:26.960 he could have easily enjoyed causing
02:40:29.040 pain keeping the position he had and no
02:40:31.880 one would have suspected in fact he has
02:40:34.640 a lot to lose if he makes a big change
02:40:37.680 his whole life his relationships the
02:40:40.560 professional respect he has earned the
02:40:42.720 freedom to practice what he is best at
02:40:45.479 all of it would have been lost if he
02:40:47.000 followed a path of violence for his own
02:40:48.920 iny enjoyment it may instead have been R
02:40:52.640 because it required someone capable of
02:40:54.880 halting their emotions lell may have
02:40:57.880 required someone who was up to the task
02:41:00.520 he alone at that point in history had
02:41:02.520 the ability to do this so he took up a
02:41:05.520 role that despite its unpleasantness L
02:41:08.439 andelle viewed as necessary a solution
02:41:11.399 was needed even if it was a polo but it
02:41:14.840 was in pursuit of this solution that R
02:41:17.439 acted not from evil R doesn't turn off
02:41:20.600 his emotions because he is unfeeling he
02:41:23.399 turns them off because he does feel
02:41:25.479 empathy for the omen they are not to
02:41:28.000 blame for their birth and he knows it
02:41:30.920 this empathy prevents him from being
02:41:33.000 effective it gets in the way of what he
02:41:35.399 believes or what the capital believes is
02:41:38.319 necessary whether that belief is right
02:41:40.640 or wrong is to be explored with a look
02:41:42.800 dedicated to Omens but for perfumer
02:41:45.680 Rollo em bibing his physic was a
02:41:48.240 sacrifice facing such a nightmarish
02:41:50.920 labor he stops his emotions all of them
02:41:54.640 sacrificing all the good ones in the
02:41:56.680 process so he can operate
02:41:59.720 unflinchingly the perfumers are not
02:42:02.200 against this and nor is lender after R
02:42:05.880 paves the way the perfumers split off a
02:42:07.960 branch into a new profession the sect of
02:42:11.560 omen
02:42:12.880 Killers to this day The Omen Killers
02:42:15.720 still have a working relationship with
02:42:17.439 the lendelle perfumers as we see them
02:42:19.760 together in various perfumer outposts
02:42:22.399 the most notable example being The
02:42:24.200 perfumer's Grotto on the edge of the
02:42:26.000 capital when we meet The Omen Killers
02:42:28.560 themselves they certainly operate with a
02:42:30.920 ruthlessness that seems void of emotion
02:42:33.920 what is immediate on first impression is
02:42:36.200 their equipment it is certainly unique
02:42:39.240 their Garb honors R their Founder The
02:42:42.399 Robe is thick like Ros thick enough
02:42:45.279 leather to take the impact of omen horns
02:42:48.520 and traditional like the perfumer robes
02:42:51.960 aprons are worn by doctors and healers
02:42:55.120 experimenters with volatile substances
02:42:58.200 and butchers the perfumers have now
02:43:01.479 filled all of these categories The Omen
02:43:04.880 killer mask is inspired from knowledge
02:43:07.200 picked up while attempting to help Omens
02:43:10.240 secrets about their nightmares shared to
02:43:12.800 perfumers in positions of trust are now
02:43:15.760 turned against them hideous and taunting
02:43:19.399 the mask is in the appearance of an evil
02:43:21.840 spirit which haunts The Omen in their
02:43:23.720 dreams called an elder what an elder is
02:43:27.520 or Elder of what is uncertain the
02:43:30.479 curving horn is Omen likee and the face
02:43:32.960 is Twisted in a mocking expression made
02:43:36.000 so that the omen killer seems to take
02:43:38.040 pleasure in the violence which of course
02:43:40.600 they cannot but the effect on the hunted
02:43:43.600 is undeniable the perfumers are
02:43:46.479 practiced at influencing the mind and
02:43:48.600 the emotion
02:43:49.800 and those lessons carry over Beyond
02:43:53.359 perfumes key words in the omen items
02:43:56.960 buter Slaughter implies a great deal of
02:44:00.640 ease as well as a sense of the human to
02:44:03.800 nonhuman we butcher a cow and slaughter
02:44:07.200 a pig and the word Butchery May imply
02:44:10.040 some usage of the corpse despite the
02:44:12.240 danger of their horns there may be some
02:44:14.279 use in them too to perfumers or to Omen
02:44:17.640 Killers themselves at the very least the
02:44:20.359 omen Killers use these horns to Fashion
02:44:22.600 their weapons their monstrous Cleavers
02:44:25.000 are likely very effective against Omen
02:44:27.680 like with like just as sharp dragon
02:44:30.439 scales do extra damage to dragons
02:44:33.279 perhaps the horns May nullify the slain
02:44:35.760 chances to return to the UR tree not to
02:44:38.439 mention the fear the weapon would create
02:44:40.760 as an omen killer charged forward to
02:44:43.240 color your species numbers these hunts
02:44:46.479 go on and on from from R and those
02:44:50.200 inspired by him right until the present
02:44:55.840 day another cultural impact the
02:44:58.399 perfumers have on the world is on the
02:45:00.520 beginnings of the deathbed companions
02:45:03.640 when healing fails a perfumer may ease
02:45:06.680 the passing of the dying they have all
02:45:09.720 the tools to make the passage to death
02:45:12.000 gentler they can influence emotions and
02:45:14.920 Sensations relaxing the patient calming
02:45:17.960 them dulling the pain or even perhaps
02:45:20.920 replacing it we find perfumers in lelle
02:45:24.319 doing this same kindness enemies who we
02:45:27.240 cannot do damage to but who are not
02:45:29.520 fully dead receive perfumer attention to
02:45:32.319 calm the mind to give them a gentle
02:45:34.760 passing this is said to be similar to
02:45:37.000 the origins of the deathbed companions
02:45:39.439 implying that the deathbed companions
02:45:41.439 may have discovered their own craft by
02:45:43.640 simply helping those at death's door
02:45:45.600 feel better only to then discover what
02:45:48.279 was possible
02:45:49.600 the balin's blessing is described as a
02:45:52.120 favor which allows one to forget any
02:45:54.640 aches and pains which is remarkably like
02:45:57.560 the perfumer's last recourse is this
02:46:00.479 just a coincidence and the deathbed
02:46:02.680 companions emerged independently from
02:46:04.800 the perfumers and the two are unrelated
02:46:07.319 to each other we think it is more than a
02:46:10.200 coincidence and that perfumers some time
02:46:12.560 ago had a real influence on the origins
02:46:14.880 of the deathbed companions when we find
02:46:17.560 the deathbed dress we are in Lal near
02:46:20.920 perfumers and perfumer rooms we are in a
02:46:23.920 building which is decorated with images
02:46:26.080 of elegant flowers with their pollen
02:46:28.240 stams on
02:46:29.920 display and there is an omen killer
02:46:33.160 nearby on top of that when we find feia
02:46:36.399 she has plants that we also find in
02:46:38.880 perfumer rooms and perfumer incense
02:46:43.600 diffusers much of her equipment looks
02:46:46.200 very like what is in lendel perfumer
02:46:48.399 rooms
02:46:50.720 while we cannot know the exact history
02:46:52.840 it seems that the role of perfumers had
02:46:54.800 an impact on the creation of the
02:46:56.319 deathbed Companions and there was at
02:46:58.640 least a flow of Knowledge from perfumers
02:47:01.080 towards the deathbed companions for some
02:47:03.560 time the emergence of deathbed
02:47:05.920 companions happened long ago enough for
02:47:07.920 them to embed themselves in the culture
02:47:10.040 and in some lands become deeply
02:47:12.399 respected this takes deep time in fear's
02:47:15.920 land it is seen as a sacred Act this
02:47:19.600 likely puts it well before the
02:47:21.200 shattering for something to grow as a
02:47:23.520 craft to spread throughout the lands
02:47:25.880 develop its own techniques and garments
02:47:28.680 earn respect and eventually be sought
02:47:31.479 after by Champions and Lords means its
02:47:34.399 Beginnings were long ago indeed there
02:47:37.240 has even passed enough lifetimes to
02:47:39.880 understand that only once in a lifetime
02:47:41.920 does a deathbed companion give up a
02:47:44.120 radiant Balin
02:47:45.960 blessing once again the influence of the
02:47:48.560 per perfumers seems to have diffused
02:47:51.359 everywhere what other cultural
02:47:53.479 splintering happens during the perfumer
02:47:55.720 history one subtle one is noticeable
02:47:58.680 today during their service the perfumers
02:48:01.760 meet others who serve the pages during
02:48:05.720 Le andel's long existence the perfumers
02:48:08.560 and the pages both attend to Nobles and
02:48:11.120 Lords they would inevitably talk and get
02:48:14.200 to know each other and the evidence of
02:48:15.880 the Page's relationship with perfumers
02:48:18.040 is obvious everywhere pages are found in
02:48:21.240 perfumer rooms in the capital more
02:48:23.200 frequently than perfumers themselves and
02:48:25.720 can be found face to face over a bar
02:48:28.600 perhaps about to share a
02:48:31.240 pint another splintering is towards
02:48:34.240 anti- tree sentiment While most anti-
02:48:37.359 leandel perfumers arise much later it is
02:48:40.240 inevitable that some perfumers resent
02:48:42.439 their masters and wish to explore
02:48:44.359 perfuming further without
02:48:46.680 regulations some Arts aband by landelle
02:48:49.840 and much of this Banning is unlikely to
02:48:52.000 be during the war of the shattering once
02:48:54.439 perfuming spreads to the enemy to whom
02:48:56.800 leand Del's Authority doesn't reach uh
02:48:59.160 ban wouldn't make sense with such high
02:49:01.840 numbers certain perfumers would always
02:49:04.120 stray from the straight and narrow after
02:49:06.720 all with so many ingredients just
02:49:08.800 sitting there it's only a matter of time
02:49:11.240 before some of them start testing on
02:49:13.760 themselves indeed poison spray mist
02:49:16.439 reveals that even when perfumer art were
02:49:19.040 still restorative perfume powder was
02:49:21.399 held in the mouth before being expelled
02:49:24.680 if healing with morphine required the
02:49:26.680 same method how long until there would
02:49:28.600 be such problems given time and overuse
02:49:32.080 some self-destruction cannot be avoided
02:49:34.920 the seeds of depravity and heresy now
02:49:38.239 start to appear amongst the
02:49:40.520 perfumers of course even perfumers who
02:49:43.239 stay loyal to lendelle and stick to the
02:49:45.600 rules cannot claim a clear conscience
02:49:48.439 they too show the signs of
02:49:50.720 overexposure if the substances are held
02:49:53.000 in the mouth even for restorative Arts
02:49:56.160 then perhaps we cannot blame them but we
02:49:58.920 cannot deny the ingredients for these
02:50:00.920 medicines flowers that feed on human
02:50:04.080 flesh are these perfumers better than
02:50:06.560 those straying from the rules or are
02:50:08.520 they just better perceived in the eyes
02:50:10.399 of the capital to heal a lord is worth
02:50:13.120 more than a 100 commoner lives no doubt
02:50:16.000 and how much of a commoner's time or
02:50:18.000 well-being is worth a Lord's good sleep
02:50:20.760 or vibrant Daydream whatever uses the
02:50:23.600 perfumers put the pollen to the plants
02:50:26.319 must be fed so perfumers and their sects
02:50:30.319 range from the hypocritical to the
02:50:32.960 gruesome but all of this will turn for
02:50:35.640 the worse with the
02:50:38.840 shattering as the demigods rise against
02:50:41.439 each other a great War breaks out the
02:50:44.239 perfumers still loyal to lendelle fight
02:50:46.279 for the capital what was once a craft
02:50:48.800 reserved for healing with occasional
02:50:50.920 deviant in the ranks is now recruited
02:50:53.800 for
02:50:54.840 Warfare given Shields of gold to mark
02:50:57.760 their loyalty and their importance to
02:50:59.920 the capital their new War equipment is
02:51:02.520 light it is meant to be used by the body
02:51:05.160 of a Healer not a warrior most carry an
02:51:08.720 earth steal dagger light and in the past
02:51:11.760 reserved for Nobles once again we see
02:51:14.680 the respect landelle has for its
02:51:16.800 perfumers The Shield they wear is highly
02:51:19.319 immune boosting in Warfare just as in
02:51:22.080 healing there will be exposure to your
02:51:24.120 own product to help the war effort the
02:51:27.160 Masters among the perfumers create new
02:51:29.319 weapons with old knowledge and old tools
02:51:32.840 large scent diffusers once used for
02:51:35.160 healing perfumes are turned into giant
02:51:37.840 Siege arrows to spread toxins amongst
02:51:41.239 the enemy
02:51:47.010 [Music]
02:51:53.319 as the war drags on landelle realizes
02:51:55.920 that it cannot win this war without
02:51:57.640 further compromise the law against fire
02:52:01.160 Bann in the culture of the earthree is
02:52:03.520 relaxed to help the perfumers and others
02:52:06.200 have greater impact after this the
02:52:09.000 formidable perfumer bolt is designed and
02:52:12.040 shared with other Warriors still
02:52:14.479 memorably used to this day by those
02:52:16.680 close to the perfumers the pages
02:52:19.800 perfumers also become involved in
02:52:21.880 Gargoyle development this is at the
02:52:24.560 latest during the shattering if not
02:52:26.680 before the Gargoyles are held together
02:52:29.439 with corpse wax a patchwork of Heroes a
02:52:32.920 product that immediately has the air of
02:52:35.640 perfumers the moral questions that a
02:52:37.960 product like corpse wax poses are
02:52:40.279 familiar to the perfumers and they are
02:52:42.160 well trained at ignoring such questions
02:52:45.239 once the law against fire is lowered
02:52:47.399 during the shattering they certainly
02:52:49.080 lend their creative hand to these
02:52:50.640 gargoyles arming them with perfumer
02:52:53.279 Sparks One such gargoyle is outside a
02:52:56.200 perfume room in landal guarding the
02:52:58.720 perfumer Treasure Trove within it emits
02:53:01.520 totally visually unique perfume spark
02:53:04.120 fire a weapon Beyond any doubt created
02:53:07.359 by the
02:53:08.399 perfumers these gargoyles are also found
02:53:11.399 in the nameless Eternal
02:53:13.279 City and the twin Valiant gargoyles use
02:53:16.520 a poison attack that looks a lot like
02:53:18.560 like the perfumer's
02:53:20.359 creation new flammable aromatics and
02:53:23.160 techniques are devised and bottled used
02:53:25.880 to wound and kill beautiful and deadly
02:53:29.479 we ourselves experience how effective
02:53:31.720 they can be but the greatest power of
02:53:34.359 the perfumers as ever is the power over
02:53:37.640 the Mind by this time even the most
02:53:40.640 honorable perfumer knows that the
02:53:42.720 influence of perfumes on emotions is
02:53:45.279 profound during each healing they have
02:53:47.760 felt it this craft of emotional
02:53:50.600 engineering is now made into military
02:53:52.760 weapons both against the enemy and for
02:53:55.680 allies the perfumers develop concoctions
02:53:58.640 designed to influence the mind of the
02:54:00.319 earthree soldiers one they still use to
02:54:03.279 this day a staple of the shattering has
02:54:05.880 a potent moral raising effect that makes
02:54:08.560 those accustomed to it Fearless in the
02:54:10.760 face of death to give the troops such
02:54:13.960 belief such emotional strength is a
02:54:16.840 weapon of extreme power
02:54:18.840 how much bigger would an enemy Army have
02:54:20.640 to be to win against an army totally
02:54:23.080 unafraid of death any enemy Commander
02:54:26.000 would take paw it is also likely while
02:54:29.239 we don't find any that there are
02:54:30.960 perfumes developed to influence the
02:54:32.680 enemy's mind we can see judging from the
02:54:35.479 color that it is poison fumes being
02:54:37.640 emitted from the giant perfume
02:54:39.520 projectiles but amongst all the
02:54:41.680 inventions why not make a perfume to
02:54:43.920 instill fear and panic in the enemy's
02:54:46.319 Hearts if it wasn't invented it should
02:54:49.120 have been thanks to the power of
02:54:51.920 influencing the minds on the battlefield
02:54:54.200 perfumers are promoted to commanders and
02:54:56.680 it is stated that they were exceptional
02:54:59.479 even more bizarre than healers starting
02:55:01.840 with man eating flowers as a first
02:55:03.920 ingredient is healers becoming leaders
02:55:06.840 of
02:55:08.479 war in the chaos of War it is more than
02:55:11.960 rules that start to fragment deviant
02:55:14.680 perfumers have been a minority before
02:55:16.600 the shattering however during the war
02:55:19.080 lendelle can no longer jealously guard
02:55:21.359 this craft successfully and this begins
02:55:23.960 to
02:55:24.760 change but after the perfumers were
02:55:27.359 drafted into service during the
02:55:28.960 shattering the Art became widely
02:55:31.160 practiced throughout the lands between
02:55:33.359 the craft of perfuming now spreads
02:55:35.640 across the land removed from the laws of
02:55:38.200 the UR Trey these new perfumers take a
02:55:40.760 powerful tool that has occasionally
02:55:42.720 dipped into depravity and twist it all
02:55:45.120 the way to heresy some starters denters
02:55:49.439 some Outsiders but all begin to
02:55:51.880 experiment with what is possible and in
02:55:54.120 numbers never seen before over time as
02:55:57.160 the shattering drags on and on they
02:55:59.439 invent bizarre and warped techniques
02:56:02.399 described as so perilous that no
02:56:05.399 physician would even attempt them this
02:56:07.840 makes it sound that simply the invention
02:56:09.960 of these perfumes is extremely dangerous
02:56:12.160 to the Creator one full step during its
02:56:14.960 conception and you may die in the
02:56:17.200 process just imagine how perilous poison
02:56:20.200 spray mist would have been in its early
02:56:22.160 invention stage as it stands today
02:56:24.960 poison as opposed to Healing products
02:56:27.399 must be held in the mouth before being
02:56:29.800 expelled as the innovator what a deadly
02:56:32.840 Road To Tread when depraved perfumers
02:56:36.040 are employed as mercenaries they
02:56:38.040 influence the emotions of their troops
02:56:40.040 just as landelle perfumers do but with
02:56:42.680 much more extreme techniques they can
02:56:45.800 take a man whose limbs are frozen stiff
02:56:48.040 with fear taunt him and put them in a
02:56:51.160 state of fervor the results are instant
02:56:54.319 Berserkers ready to be used against the
02:56:56.720 enemy with the name like blood boil it
02:56:59.960 isn't Pleasant to think of how this
02:57:01.760 perfume may work throughout this period
02:57:04.960 the depraved perfumers consume more and
02:57:07.600 more of their own Supply as they embibe
02:57:10.840 their own spices they descend into
02:57:13.600 self-destruction earning the name the
02:57:15.760 culture of the lands between gives them
02:57:18.239 depraved
02:57:19.680 perfumers it cannot be denied that they
02:57:21.840 invent some interesting perfumes morally
02:57:24.520 questionable at the least if not
02:57:26.479 repellent they nevertheless develop some
02:57:29.160 of the most effective recipes we will
02:57:31.160 ever find it is said that depraved
02:57:33.840 perfumers work for themselves alone but
02:57:36.399 there is evidence that they worked with
02:57:38.080 troops on the battlefield in the
02:57:39.640 shattering we can assume that it's
02:57:41.800 likely that during the shattering some
02:57:43.920 chose to work as mercenaries not truly
02:57:46.680 loyal just getting p
02:57:49.160 to this day we find depraved perfumers
02:57:51.520 following their own interests and
02:57:53.399 trading their talents for gain just as
02:57:56.560 with lendelle perfumers and economy
02:57:58.840 around these depraved perfumers and
02:58:00.720 their Arts Rises as well depraved
02:58:03.399 perfumers have a longer shopping list
02:58:05.720 and far fewer Scruples both of these
02:58:08.239 facts are good for Commerce the evidence
02:58:10.720 is that business is booming too in the
02:58:13.200 lands between depraved perfumers have a
02:58:15.760 much higher drop rate for all items when
02:58:18.680 you discard morals it is much easier to
02:58:21.279 procure Goods that cost human lives one
02:58:24.840 new ingredient that requires death to
02:58:26.880 obtain Almost Human death or perhaps
02:58:30.399 more than human is an ingredient from
02:58:32.720 living jars depraved perfumers need the
02:58:36.040 broken shards and innards of these jars
02:58:38.319 to make new inventions when there is any
02:58:41.000 new payoff you can bet that those
02:58:42.880 without Scruples will emerge to Profit
02:58:45.479 poaches start hunting the jars to meet
02:58:47.479 the demand
02:58:48.560 the depraved perfumers become in League
02:58:50.880 with these poachers paying them for what
02:58:53.000 they harvest from the jars they kill
02:58:55.359 effectively a corpse for cash business
02:58:58.160 it's nothing new for perfumers but the
02:59:00.200 depraved like to do things bigger there
02:59:03.399 are likely to be many jar related
02:59:05.520 perfumes but we only discover one during
02:59:07.960 our time in the lands between an
02:59:10.520 undeniably powerful perfume costly but
02:59:14.279 undeniably
02:59:16.120 powerful interestingly like other
02:59:18.640 lendelle aromatics it is made with an
02:59:21.040 ingredient that has Humanity coursing
02:59:23.359 through it just like Miranda flow pollen
02:59:26.560 this essence of humanity that fed the
02:59:28.960 plant and built the jar or channeled
02:59:31.800 through them seems to work well in
02:59:33.680 perfumes Humanity channeled through
02:59:36.439 almost Humanity poachers don't care for
02:59:39.560 the mysteries of the perfumer craft but
02:59:41.800 they know depraved perfumers will pay
02:59:43.800 the price and maybe even some perfumers
02:59:46.640 of lendelle will too
02:59:48.680 just as with earlier in history Rising
02:59:50.920 values affect Supply but this time it is
02:59:53.640 the pots who will use secrecy to cut off
02:59:56.000 others profiting the jar Community
02:59:58.439 adapts to these conditions some move to
03:00:01.160 a secret Village in order to avoid being
03:00:03.319 poached and likely many others do the
03:00:05.640 same if they are out there though the
03:00:08.160 village we find doesn't stay secret
03:00:10.120 forever
03:00:11.560 unfortunately but in some justice the
03:00:14.319 Ora side tomb has been taken over by
03:00:16.920 Warrior jaars at some point Warrior jars
03:00:19.960 catch one unfortunate inventor or
03:00:22.520 carrier of the iron jar aromatic
03:00:24.520 perfumer recipe with what is likely two
03:00:27.359 other poachers they lock them up until
03:00:30.040 death takes them revenge is
03:00:33.040 sweet there is some evidence that
03:00:35.399 depraved perfumers or at least one
03:00:38.000 perfumer since the outbreak of the
03:00:39.520 shattering worked in League with
03:00:41.680 Reichard in the volcano Mana there is a
03:00:44.520 perfume bottle a remarkably rare item in
03:00:47.279 the lands between
03:00:48.600 it is hard to make and essential to
03:00:50.720 perfumer crafting and use nearby are the
03:00:54.000 ashes of depraved perfumer Karman he's
03:00:57.279 described as a notably formidable
03:00:59.640 perfumer whose strength rivaled that of
03:01:01.960 Heroes it also states that he was in
03:01:04.439 search of a secret physic of
03:01:07.000 revivification it would make sense for
03:01:08.960 him to travel to the volcano Mana where
03:01:11.399 work has been done on living forever
03:01:13.720 with rikart himself thinking he's not
03:01:16.120 killable did K on Ally himself to
03:01:18.920 volcano Mana was he passing through the
03:01:22.120 word hero May hint at why he was
03:01:24.680 interrupted in his work as he can be
03:01:27.479 summoned this usually means that the
03:01:29.319 ghost has some task left unfinished it
03:01:32.200 is likely he never found or invented the
03:01:34.880 physic of
03:01:36.720 revivification Perhaps it is because the
03:01:39.359 great hero was welcomed as
03:01:43.040 family Omens receed some minor Freedom
03:01:46.399 thanks to the shattering they are used
03:01:48.520 as Warriors employed for their brute
03:01:50.680 strength and armed with weapons to take
03:01:53.000 advantage of it the cleaver states that
03:01:55.359 the weapon is cursed so that the omen
03:01:57.399 will not be armed for long after serving
03:01:59.720 their purpose landelle doesn't want them
03:02:02.000 to be armed for longer than they are
03:02:03.640 useful the weapon is built to break
03:02:06.800 before the shattering the urry condoned
03:02:09.080 the hunting of Omens and secretly locks
03:02:11.720 them away if they were royalty yet in
03:02:14.399 times of need lendelle Stoops to
03:02:16.680 compromise and the these same creatures
03:02:18.880 were given the chance to fight as
03:02:20.680 Warriors and the chance to
03:02:24.160 escape the shattering goes on and on the
03:02:28.319 lands are ravaged and no one is a Victor
03:02:31.680 but the perfumers The Omen Killers Pages
03:02:35.439 the deathbed Companions and the depraved
03:02:38.080 perfumers all survive and are active
03:02:40.560 When we arrive in the lands
03:02:42.439 between let us look at the perfumers and
03:02:45.120 their branching sects in the present day
03:02:48.200 we find that the omen Killers continue
03:02:50.319 to carry out their nightmarish tasks
03:02:52.680 with brutal tenacity no one with cursed
03:02:55.680 blood is safe they still live somewhat
03:02:58.359 symbiotically with perfumers and Miranda
03:03:00.880 flowers and one can only speculate
03:03:03.520 whether their access to charred corpses
03:03:05.720 leads to an expedient solution for the
03:03:08.000 perfumers The Grotto are certainly
03:03:10.479 filled with bags of what seems to be Ash
03:03:15.000 fertilizer one perfumer we encounter
03:03:17.479 seems seems to remain focused on healing
03:03:20.120 Trisha is a living perfumer who started
03:03:22.600 the quest to heal Mis begotten Omens and
03:03:25.560 all those viewed as impure she is still
03:03:28.600 alive and during her lifetime she has
03:03:30.920 only met with failure another traveling
03:03:34.000 perfumer of no Renown is searching for
03:03:36.600 new Gardens with new ingredients that
03:03:39.160 might help cure the same mistreated
03:03:41.000 groups this traveler is working for a
03:03:43.479 Healer as an associate as we find the
03:03:46.319 armor on a corpse he may have died along
03:03:49.000 his journey but we can assume there is
03:03:51.439 at least a small community or several
03:03:54.000 around Trisha or others who still strive
03:03:56.920 to heal with their powers whether this
03:03:59.319 will spread to inspire others in the
03:04:01.160 lands between or whether this small
03:04:03.200 light of healing will go out we do not
03:04:05.800 know we certainly do not help Trisha has
03:04:09.880 given up on the Cure and instead uses
03:04:12.359 her craft to make the journey into death
03:04:14.439 more gentle for these creatures a taale
03:04:17.200 which as as we have mentioned is similar
03:04:19.040 to the origins of the deathbed
03:04:20.600 companions long ago like perfuming
03:04:23.920 though deathbed companionship is a
03:04:26.279 practice which will also turn to heresy
03:04:29.000 as fear uses it against the
03:04:31.600 order Capital perfumers are still going
03:04:34.520 about their work still researching and
03:04:37.120 healing but still military they still
03:04:40.319 have relationships with Pages who have
03:04:42.319 close contact with them who Pace the
03:04:44.399 perfumer libraries and Laboratories
03:04:46.840 armed with per perfumer bolts while
03:04:49.319 surviving gargoyles still attack with
03:04:51.640 perfumer Weaponry the depraved perfumers
03:04:54.880 are dotted around the world more
03:04:57.000 unnerving than their leandel
03:04:58.680 counterparts it is more than just their
03:05:01.000 skin and eyes their outfit is unsettling
03:05:04.319 when we loot them we discover that the
03:05:06.160 image on their robe has a meaning it is
03:05:08.479 a curse invoked upon the her tree is it
03:05:12.279 snakes wrapping around the tree Flames
03:05:15.760 or is it not a tree at all something
03:05:18.359 more philosophical something more
03:05:21.080 fundamental certainly snakes are seen as
03:05:23.840 traitors to the earthree and it is very
03:05:26.439 possible that kman worked for Reichard
03:05:29.120 and that others gave their service as
03:05:30.880 mercenaries on the battle for the
03:05:32.359 volcano Mana or perhaps when turned
03:05:35.640 upside down it is a Candle Tree a
03:05:38.279 forbidden design which is thought to
03:05:40.479 represent a stitious prophecy of
03:05:43.160 cardinal sin they certainly take their
03:05:45.800 heresy very seriously
03:05:48.960 one musical perfumer plays the same tune
03:05:52.000 of the leandel pages
03:06:01.440 [Music]
03:06:13.670 [Music]
03:06:20.279 further strengthening the idea that some
03:06:22.399 depraved perfumers were originally from
03:06:24.359 landal and have strayed
03:06:26.479 since nearby is an omen killer who we
03:06:29.760 cannot reach without aggressing the
03:06:31.359 depraved perfumer allies or coincidence
03:06:34.720 we will never
03:06:36.520 know many depraved perfumers are at the
03:06:39.439 Shaded Castle while the castle has been
03:06:42.239 taken over recently by Elma of the Brier
03:06:45.000 it is doubtful the perfumers are there
03:06:46.920 for him as there is evidence that they
03:06:48.960 are there because of Marley Mariah what
03:06:51.680 the head of the castle had been doing
03:06:53.399 before losing control is worthy of
03:06:55.920 speculation his obsession with melenia
03:06:58.399 and rot makes us wonder whether the bog
03:07:00.760 outside the castle is his personal
03:07:02.960 attempt at creating a RW swamp there are
03:07:05.760 also Miranda flowers throughout the
03:07:07.640 castle further putting into question the
03:07:10.040 possible biological closeness between
03:07:12.239 these flowers humans and the women who
03:07:15.000 can bloom but staying focused on on
03:07:17.760 perfumers it is certain that there are
03:07:19.800 abundant Miranda flowers to harvest and
03:07:22.479 it being a castle of execution with
03:07:25.040 unending corpses and human flesh for the
03:07:27.520 flowers to feed on means an unending
03:07:30.279 supply of ingredients for the depraved
03:07:32.399 to craft their perfumes in exchange it
03:07:35.439 is possible they provide perfumes that
03:07:37.800 help Marley Mariah who is sickly born
03:07:40.680 and may also teach him some depraved
03:07:43.319 Arts he uses a poison attack that
03:07:46.560 neither looks like the perfumer's poison
03:07:48.880 spray
03:07:49.710 [Music]
03:07:51.439 mist or poison Mist
03:08:00.800 incantation Omen killers are still
03:08:03.239 active in the lands between they are
03:08:05.399 described as butchers of Twisted
03:08:07.600 conscience it may be twisted as in evil
03:08:10.640 or it may be twisted as in knotted
03:08:13.640 blocked silenced in the present day they
03:08:17.080 are at least on good terms with the
03:08:18.880 perfumers and Miranda flowers neither
03:08:21.760 group is aggressive towards them and
03:08:23.560 they are found together at Gardens and
03:08:25.720 hideouts across the lands between their
03:08:28.479 other allegiances are varied if they
03:08:31.040 exist at all it is speculative whether
03:08:33.560 they allied with Gideon or Reichard but
03:08:36.080 the only thing for sure is that the omen
03:08:38.040 Killers continue to focus on what R
03:08:40.560 began with some additions a cursed blood
03:08:44.479 that is unnatural and against the order
03:08:46.560 of the Ury is what started the omen hunt
03:08:49.600 and another creature has arisen in
03:08:51.720 history with a cursed blood Alban norx
03:08:55.640 in the aloric village we find an omen
03:08:57.960 killer among mounds of corpses and a
03:09:01.000 near identical scene is in volcano Mana
03:09:04.279 aloric lower legs missing lay
03:09:06.880 slaughtered and strung up killing them
03:09:09.960 and spilling their cursed blood is not
03:09:11.920 enough The Omen Killers burn them
03:09:14.359 watching over the fire diligently as
03:09:16.600 they burn the tra pie es of their
03:09:18.000 accursed blood from the earth were they
03:09:20.840 always allowed fire to burn away
03:09:22.800 accursed blood since the beginnings they
03:09:25.520 use it in combat and post combat did
03:09:29.000 they always have some flexibility with
03:09:30.760 the 's rules or is this a post
03:09:33.520 shattering development for now we don't
03:09:38.200 know violent Delights have violent ends
03:09:41.960 as wonderful as the effect of perfumes
03:09:44.120 may have been harvesting human suffering
03:09:46.720 and death for use in healing is a
03:09:48.960 foundation destined to fail at The
03:09:51.479 Descent to self-use military use and the
03:09:54.479 relaxing of rules and it's no surprise
03:09:57.000 where we are now indeed we may not have
03:09:59.960 seen the end of heretical behavior
03:10:02.160 seeded by the perfumers if being next to
03:10:05.000 what you wish to heal for long enough
03:10:06.600 led to Omen Killers what other roles
03:10:08.920 that were close to Lords and gods might
03:10:11.800 lead to violence as the dagger Talisman
03:10:14.720 States a sense of Mercy is a cat Cal IST
03:10:17.920 for blood lust not to mention the misery
03:10:20.840 cords warning beware the killers clothed
03:10:23.960 as men of
03:10:25.640 compassion but that's for another time
03:10:29.000 we feel the Temptation Of The Power of
03:10:31.000 perfumes ourselves what is one living
03:10:33.399 jar compared to the power of iron the
03:10:36.399 landelle perfumers themselves used human
03:10:39.080 flashh they stayed working with om
03:10:41.479 Killers even in the center of one of
03:10:44.040 their secret gardens closest to the
03:10:46.239 capital there is is shamefully a
03:10:48.760 treasure Trove of living jar shards
03:10:52.080 depravity is only depravity until it out
03:10:55.680 competes then it becomes mainstream and
03:10:58.840 everyone gets on board the perfumers
03:11:02.160 started with bad Beginnings the roots
03:11:04.800 fed by pain and the seeds of such a
03:11:07.359 practice will surely and always breed
03:11:11.080 heresy
03:11:22.080 morgot didn't care about Omens after he
03:11:26.040 became king he left his Omen Brothers
03:11:28.920 locked up in the sewers he used them in
03:11:32.319 the war of the
03:11:33.760 shattering he sent them into battle with
03:11:36.439 Cleavers with merely a wrap of cloth for
03:11:38.920 a handle a weapon cursed to break he
03:11:42.760 rose to power but did nothing for his
03:11:45.640 kind for morgot was not an omen Saint he
03:11:50.560 was a saint for the ER tree its most
03:11:53.720 loyal
03:11:54.920 Apostle he loved the urry and though
03:11:57.600 this love was unrequited he devoted all
03:12:00.040 his power his cunning and his
03:12:02.720 unquestioning obedience to
03:12:06.239 it it led only to failure and death but
03:12:11.200 morot believes he lived and died with
03:12:14.760 honor but his honor rests on the
03:12:17.520 framework of his beliefs disgust May
03:12:21.600 mislead empathy can mislead we must
03:12:25.359 quiet both to find what morgot really
03:12:28.040 did in the lands
03:12:29.920 between because
03:12:31.760 morgot is an
03:12:34.380 [Music]
03:12:37.760 enigma morgot was born a
03:12:41.479 filia his parents were strong and
03:12:44.399 beautiful a goddess and a warrior
03:12:47.920 morgot along with his twin inherited
03:12:50.840 strength but not Beauty and many far too
03:12:55.279 many other traits besides the traits of
03:12:58.520 many creatures many Minds many
03:13:03.840 Souls whether morgot and MOG were born
03:13:06.760 after their brother Godwin or they were
03:13:09.200 America's first children we do not yet
03:13:11.680 know what is clear is the Stark
03:13:14.160 difference between the siblings Godwin
03:13:17.319 is almost a parody of a demigod his
03:13:20.000 appearance something found only in myth
03:13:22.479 or art morgot is born horned tailed
03:13:27.200 coated in fur his twin winged and
03:13:32.600 fanged Godwin is very likely given a
03:13:35.760 finger Maiden as a wet nurse given
03:13:38.439 Freedom status and goes on to honor the
03:13:41.720 golden lineage in his lifetime morgot is
03:13:45.560 kept secret sent below the capital and
03:13:48.680 locked away for the shame and danger he
03:13:51.279 represents for morgot was not worshiped
03:13:54.359 as a signifier of the Divine even at his
03:13:57.080 birth he was born one of the graceless
03:14:00.760 Omen at his first moment the greater
03:14:03.720 will rejects him America and Godfrey
03:14:06.960 recognize this Godfrey the leader of the
03:14:10.080 famous Crucible Knights Knights who at
03:14:12.720 the time of morg God's birth are still
03:14:14.960 honored understands the difference
03:14:17.920 the knights have the blessing of
03:14:19.960 potential morgot has its curse as morgot
03:14:24.279 was born one of them it is likely some
03:14:26.760 others have come before and they were
03:14:29.080 all
03:14:30.600 graceless Marica and Godfrey name their
03:14:33.359 son morgot but it is a name that no one
03:14:36.000 will know until much later for their son
03:14:39.439 is to be kept a
03:14:41.760 secret How could a child of the golden
03:14:44.439 lineage the golden bow be so
03:14:47.560 formed if those blessed by gold could
03:14:50.359 have such disordered Offspring then it
03:14:52.880 is more than an omen it is proof that at
03:14:56.239 some point the system will fail so on
03:15:00.600 his birth they hide him away and then
03:15:03.640 see to it that morgot is locked up away
03:15:07.040 from prying eyes underground unbeknownst
03:15:11.080 to anyone imprisoned for
03:15:14.040 eternity and we know it is in secret
03:15:17.640 how Godfrey calls him morgot morgot is
03:15:22.439 the name used much later in his life a
03:15:25.359 name used publicly if this name was
03:15:28.239 widely known to be the name of America's
03:15:30.439 Omen Offspring he would never be
03:15:32.640 accepted in lendal but morgot is a name
03:15:35.960 that was buried underground and he is
03:15:38.840 not only kept underground as other Royal
03:15:41.479 Omen were he is kept under strictest
03:15:44.479 confinement magically bound to the
03:15:46.560 ground by golden magic The Fetish imbued
03:15:50.120 with magic Bears the symbol during the
03:15:52.239 time of Crucible worship adapted to
03:15:55.120 represent the omen curse that relates to
03:15:57.479 it the gold draws the Blessed crucible
03:16:00.880 that birthed this new era but Omens were
03:16:04.479 never worshiped even in these early days
03:16:07.680 it is no Divine signifier it is a curse
03:16:11.399 a cause of harm and
03:16:14.160 misery morgot horns physically prevent
03:16:17.279 him from even resting his head they push
03:16:20.399 through his flesh painfully leaving
03:16:22.760 welts and SS his joints seem riddled
03:16:26.319 with arthritis his skin is pockmarked
03:16:29.920 and infected he can only see out of one
03:16:33.319 eye the other is crowded by horns horns
03:16:36.800 would have blocked both eyes entirely
03:16:39.199 but to see clearly some horns had to be
03:16:41.840 cut an operation that came at Great risk
03:16:44.680 to morat's life other horns still crowd
03:16:47.720 his right eyee but morgot prefers
03:16:50.199 compromised Vision rather than risking
03:16:52.560 death to continue clearing them
03:16:56.479 away if you're enjoying the video it
03:16:59.279 really helps us out if you like And
03:17:02.040 subscribe we've got a lot of content
03:17:04.520 planned and we can't wait to share it
03:17:07.160 with

03:17:09.520 you these are just the physical symptoms
03:17:13.520 Spirits twist and fight for release
03:17:15.800 within him thoughts emotions and desires
03:17:19.239 that are not his own battle for place
03:17:22.239 his blood boils with a maddening heat
03:17:25.040 and if sleep comes to him it comes with
03:17:28.160 nightmares nightmares haunted by Elders
03:17:32.560 for an omen is not only physically the
03:17:34.920 aspects of many body mind and soul are
03:17:38.080 all overfilled and attacked from within
03:17:41.199 it is no wonder Omens are mad aggressive
03:17:44.600 and in many ways Worthy of pity but do
03:17:48.880 not pity them and deny them their
03:17:51.160 Affliction to live as an omen is a
03:17:53.920 brutal
03:17:55.199 existence because it is a pestilence on
03:17:58.040 life itself anyone who carries it is a
03:18:00.920 great risk at the core of the treatment
03:18:03.439 of Omens is not a sadistic desire to
03:18:06.239 cause pain at least that's not how it
03:18:08.840 started and Prejudice grew with time
03:18:12.279 after all an omen does not choose to be
03:18:14.840 born cursed please please don't hate me
03:18:18.279 or curse me please in morgot case a
03:18:22.560 royal his plea was listened to with more
03:18:25.120 kindness than most Royal Omens could
03:18:27.960 have been cull like animals or cut like
03:18:30.960 commoner Omens instead they are shunned
03:18:34.720 and it is morat's own mother who likely
03:18:37.399 decided on the shunning grounds as a
03:18:39.479 solution we do not know if America cared
03:18:42.199 for morgot or even visited him during
03:18:44.680 his time below the capital but she would
03:18:47.120 see him again above ground much later
03:18:50.880 did she pity him during his confinement
03:18:53.880 some care for Omens enough to
03:18:55.760 memorialize them but did Marica love Mor
03:18:58.800 God at his birth whether born of a
03:19:01.680 mother or of a bow he is amica's child
03:19:06.080 when Amica lost her son Godwin it pushed
03:19:08.760 her to the brink but looking at history
03:19:11.239 morgot suffering does not seem to
03:19:13.239 disturb marica's Relentless plans
03:19:16.040 Godfrey is a little different Godfrey
03:19:19.279 understands what it means to have an
03:19:21.319 uncontrollable nature his appearance
03:19:24.199 hides what he is more of a beast than a
03:19:27.239 lord he must at least pity Mor God and
03:19:30.680 His Affliction however it is unlikely
03:19:33.560 Godfrey fought for morat's release and
03:19:36.120 if he did it was
03:19:37.960 unsuccessful to conduct himself as a
03:19:40.439 lord is to follow the rules of the
03:19:42.640 society even if it concerns your own son
03:19:46.760 if he at least visited his son in the
03:19:48.760 dungeons these visits cannot last for
03:19:51.960 Godfrey is sent away from the lands
03:19:54.279 between after which he will only have
03:19:57.160 one more meeting with his son once they
03:19:59.640 have both been given Grace but it will
03:20:02.199 be too late to tell him that he
03:20:04.040 conducted himself as a true
03:20:09.000 Lord morgot grows down in the shunning
03:20:13.560 grounds he must at first feel pain
03:20:17.359 confusion Panic at each terrible symptom
03:20:20.359 of his curse the disorder of mind and
03:20:23.720 body for a young morgot would have been
03:20:25.880 a constant trauma for anyone born to a
03:20:29.319 life of such conditions it may well turn
03:20:32.120 them into a
03:20:33.760 maniac in time morgot must become aware
03:20:36.920 of his place in the world and of the
03:20:39.120 nature of his curse so too does his
03:20:42.399 curse grow in power he gains the stature
03:20:45.439 of his father and a strength that in
03:20:48.040 time May match any demigod he can feel
03:20:51.319 it within him even if he cannot wield it
03:20:54.760 his blood Burns pinned To The Ground by
03:20:57.840 golden magic he must yearn to break this
03:21:00.640 seal and use the growing power of His
03:21:03.439 cursed blood his treatment May well
03:21:06.279 deserve Revenge as he now understands
03:21:08.840 what has been done to him and he resents
03:21:11.359 them for
03:21:14.199 it today the capital is quiet well past
03:21:18.640 its former glory some can hear the
03:21:21.359 groans of the Omens down
03:21:24.680 below and it disturbs them to hear it to
03:21:28.160 know these Abominations are beneath
03:21:30.319 their feet but how much worse to hear
03:21:33.080 the sounds of the capital while it
03:21:34.960 flourished from down in the shunning
03:21:39.720 grounds morgot MOG and the other Royal
03:21:43.160 Omen have to listen to the victories and
03:21:45.640 celebrations as the 's Empire expands
03:21:49.560 they must listen with an aching longing
03:21:52.199 to the joys of the citizens of lendelle
03:21:54.640 during the age of Plenty morgot receives
03:21:57.960 none of the blessings of this age and
03:22:00.600 must listen as this entire age passes
03:22:04.000 him by gold blesses the citizens of
03:22:07.720 lendal Grace guides all but the
03:22:11.279 Forsaken morgot hears his father
03:22:13.920 returning from various battles and the
03:22:16.520 celebrations of his
03:22:18.640 triumphs he hears the attack by the
03:22:21.000 ancient dragons he may hear Godwin
03:22:23.600 battle his blessed brother once again
03:22:26.160 finding
03:22:28.359 Glory he hears his mother's second
03:22:31.000 marriage to Radigan her new husband and
03:22:34.040 his new stepfather he hears these things
03:22:36.920 from the sewers
03:22:38.880 alone what he does not here is Mara
03:22:41.960 sending his father away there is no
03:22:44.800 battle to hear as godre does not fight
03:22:47.399 this order but accepts it and morgot
03:22:50.160 must only realize that his father has
03:22:52.199 left the lands between some time
03:22:54.520 afterwards he may have heard it from
03:22:56.680 Rolo the renowned perfumer who must have
03:22:59.520 visited morgot as a royal Omen capable
03:23:02.560 of speech morgot would have been of
03:23:04.720 interest to R far beyond his duties
03:23:08.160 morgot would already have been the most
03:23:10.319 important Omen below the capital at the
03:23:12.840 height of R's career it may be from
03:23:15.640 morot R learns of the omen nightmares
03:23:19.239 and incorporates it as the first Omen
03:23:21.880 killer morgot will have dealings with
03:23:24.760 these Omen Killers but much later there
03:23:27.680 is still a long while left in the sewers
03:23:31.399 morot is now without his father shunned
03:23:34.720 by his mother and unknown to the rest of
03:23:37.760 the
03:23:38.180 [Music]
03:23:39.560 world many other Omen crowd the shunning
03:23:42.359 grounds now did morgot have his twin for
03:23:45.479 company all this time or were they
03:23:48.160 separated for their confinement if so
03:23:51.520 morgot may not know he has a twin at
03:23:56.080 all as the age of Radigan goes on morgot
03:23:59.920 must reach a new State of Mind instead
03:24:02.960 of acting the way he is treated or as a
03:24:05.760 direct response to it he will choose how
03:24:09.040 to act most in the lands between behave
03:24:12.040 in a very understandable way if you
03:24:14.600 treat me as a monster so be it I shall
03:24:17.479 act as a monster but morgot decides to
03:24:20.760 act Beyond his circumstances morgot
03:24:23.960 begins to understand the realities of
03:24:26.239 the world above and accept them Omens
03:24:30.439 under the current form of order are
03:24:33.560 dangerous if he wasn't an omen but
03:24:36.520 instead the ruler of the lands between
03:24:39.120 what would he have done in the ruler's
03:24:40.880 Place morot battles with resentment and
03:24:44.399 hate and even infatuation
03:24:46.920 with his own blood and
03:24:49.000 power but even in the shadows cast by
03:24:52.479 the age of Plenty there is no doubt he
03:24:56.359 has only seen glimpses of its works but
03:24:59.399 the Earth tree is a miracle and morgot
03:25:02.960 now begins to devote himself to it not
03:25:05.880 to his mother or his family not to his
03:25:08.880 twin or Omen Brothers but to the Earth
03:25:11.840 tree and to its order where M goes
03:25:15.040 deeper into his Wild Ness and glories in
03:25:17.800 his Omen nature eventually going so far
03:25:20.399 as to try to create a whole new order
03:25:23.560 morgot believes in how things are the
03:25:26.640 urry order is already
03:25:30.160 incomparable even with its mistakes one
03:25:32.840 of which he is living with he comes to
03:25:36.120 these beliefs slowly and they will never
03:25:39.279 leave him now he must persuade his
03:25:42.399 mother to release him for America does
03:25:44.680 not trust lightly not even her own
03:25:47.560 family not even her own son but somehow
03:25:52.239 he persuades her he persuades her that
03:25:54.880 he is no longer tempted by his cursed
03:25:57.080 blood and its power he persuades her of
03:25:59.960 his devotion did Amica now ask him to
03:26:03.120 prove it or were morat's next actions
03:26:06.040 his own idea whatever the case in an act
03:26:09.640 that shows his decision to control his
03:26:11.800 Omen side and his immense willpower he
03:26:15.080 recants his aurs blood and seals it away
03:26:20.000 the word recant may also show the mental
03:26:23.040 side of this action it is also an act of
03:26:26.800 the mind and an Act of Faith he denies
03:26:30.239 the attraction of its power or even its
03:26:33.120 potential for a different order morgot
03:26:36.399 is then for the first time in his life
03:26:39.680 granted freedom he comes to the surface
03:26:43.319 and becomes a loyal servant of the
03:26:45.359 earthree
03:26:46.760 and to this end he serves America at
03:26:50.680 this point he assumes the name marget
03:26:54.199 the world has never seen him never heard
03:26:56.800 of morgot marget is an omen an
03:27:00.680 intelligent and horned Omen whose
03:27:02.680 strength is so terrible that America has
03:27:04.960 chosen him to serve her personally that
03:27:08.160 he is of the golden lineage or America
03:27:10.560 and Godfrey's son is a
03:27:13.040 secret it may be like any Beast that is
03:27:15.880 used usually killed but that shows
03:27:18.000 exceptional strength it is allowed a
03:27:20.560 small freedom marget is his public face
03:27:24.800 it is very likely that morgot keeps the
03:27:27.080 Ragged Furs from his captivity filthy
03:27:30.080 and stained to remind him of his place
03:27:33.199 they may even be a comfort now they are
03:27:35.920 made of fur fur is of an animal which is
03:27:39.359 much of his nature his head sits in a
03:27:42.199 collar shaped almost like a crucible
03:27:45.279 under the Earth tree no matter his power
03:27:47.760 or social rank he is an omen and he will
03:27:51.359 make sure he never forgets it he is
03:27:54.600 willing to live in rags to disdain and
03:27:57.359 resent himself such as his love for the
03:28:00.399 earthree a mother to a demium once made
03:28:03.640 a prattling paid sculpture in the shape
03:28:06.199 of her child's face it says you're
03:28:09.399 beautiful the description says
03:28:11.880 unconditional love unrestrained
03:28:14.479 Assurance it must have been been a
03:28:16.359 mother speaking but some women in this
03:28:19.000 world do not share these instincts is
03:28:22.279 morot humble or humbled how much is the
03:28:26.000 world responsible for his attitude or
03:28:29.160 could it be the influence of just one
03:28:31.640 person America can be ruthlessly cruel
03:28:35.640 and she treats those less than human
03:28:38.120 with brutal unkindness whether it's the
03:28:41.600 Giants a lowly blacksmith or even those
03:28:45.239 you would expect her to be kind to like
03:28:48.000 her husband her loyal other half would
03:28:51.840 the shame of her son lead to abuse for
03:28:55.359 it is not just humility morgot seems to
03:28:57.880 have is it also self-loathing his robes
03:29:02.199 aren't only Rags they are filthy they
03:29:05.600 are caked in dirt and likely wreaking as
03:29:08.800 though they haven't been washed since
03:29:10.319 leaving the sewers the creators of Elden
03:29:13.040 Ring's world have a long history of
03:29:15.080 characters abused in captivity made to
03:29:17.960 wear their filthy clothes of
03:29:19.760 imprisonment even once they are released
03:29:22.439 to remind them of their place to shame
03:29:25.439 them to keep the Mind captive even once
03:29:28.279 the body is free part of morgot
03:29:31.479 relationship to himself may also be a
03:29:33.760 vestage of some horrific treatment below
03:29:36.479 the capital but we cannot know we can
03:29:39.880 only ask why he is so harsh on
03:29:44.560 himself Margaret helps Mara and Raga
03:29:47.800 maintain their golden order he has a
03:29:50.279 connection with his mother at last as
03:29:52.800 her assassin he is charged with coloring
03:29:55.760 those who become too strong the time of
03:29:58.399 great Heroes is passed the order and the
03:30:01.279 hierarchy is established leave a hero to
03:30:04.239 strengthen too long and a new Godfree
03:30:06.640 may arise War hungry and willing to
03:30:09.319 challenge the rulers in Place Margate is
03:30:12.279 given the charge of the Knight Cavalry
03:30:14.600 who ride funeral steeds and deliver
03:30:16.760 death for great warriors Knights and
03:30:19.359 champions with death sealed it is a
03:30:22.080 required task and he takes on this
03:30:24.600 essential
03:30:26.040 responsibility these honored Heroes the
03:30:28.680 moment they become a risk would soon
03:30:31.160 receive a visit from this ER tree
03:30:33.479 loyalist there were once Heroes who
03:30:35.800 walked the battlefields abundantly
03:30:38.120 blessed by the her tree itself who upon
03:30:41.080 earning their honor simply died Margaret
03:30:44.840 was extremely effective his gruesome
03:30:47.880 appearance and terrible strength earned
03:30:50.439 him a nickname marget the fell Omen an
03:30:55.439 omen of terrible ferocity deadly for he
03:30:59.439 was fell to every hero he called upon
03:31:02.359 and no challenges rose up no harm was
03:31:05.239 brought to America or her
03:31:07.359 children until morot failed his mother
03:31:11.920 once again for one night a night that
03:31:15.960 that should have been watched over
03:31:17.239 successfully by margate's Cavalry a
03:31:19.840 group of female assassins invisible to
03:31:22.560 the eye with their magic veils Slaughter
03:31:26.000 amica's
03:31:27.359 child Godwin the dragon slayer dies in
03:31:30.479 Soul and his body is terribly damaged
03:31:33.640 and infected Amica sees her son who
03:31:37.000 should have lived a life eternal
03:31:39.600 destroyed maret's Cavalry responds so
03:31:42.399 quickly after the event they catch the
03:31:44.399 assassins in flight
03:31:47.080 they almost kill electo the ring leader
03:31:49.880 only for her daughter TSH to die
03:31:52.199 defending her his Cavalry are Relentless
03:31:55.640 and they chase down electo and lock her
03:31:58.040 in an Ever jail but margot's
03:32:00.279 responsibility was prevention not
03:32:03.479 punishment the demigods have felt their
03:32:06.160 first taste of death and marget blames
03:32:10.880 himself he creates the centes torch
03:32:14.000 imbued with magic that reveals a
03:32:15.920 assassins cloaked in veils and gives it
03:32:18.439 to the Protectors of the earth tree with
03:32:21.120 this he hopes that such a KN of black
03:32:23.680 knives will never come
03:32:26.520 again how long after Amica loses her son
03:32:30.120 does she shatter the Elden ring if death
03:32:33.160 had never come to a demigod would she
03:32:35.479 have done it at all to morot who loves
03:32:38.359 the her tree he must view this decision
03:32:41.120 as foolish perhaps even
03:32:44.680 treacherous on on the Elden ring
03:32:46.640 breaking morgot receives a gift a great
03:32:50.439 Rune hear me demig Gods my children
03:32:55.239 beloved make of thyselves that which he
03:32:59.600 desire be it Lord be it a God but should
03:33:04.560 ye fail to become ought at all ye will
03:33:08.199 be
03:33:09.000 forsaken amounting only to
03:33:13.279 sacrifices but is this true if none of
03:33:16.680 them fight each other and they come
03:33:18.640 together then things can remain as they
03:33:21.120 were when the runes are brought back
03:33:23.439 together that is when it can be rebuilt
03:33:26.399 if you loved the ER tree you shouldn't
03:33:29.040 allow America to tempt you morot knows
03:33:32.239 his place he is not Guided by the flame
03:33:35.239 of ambition do his siblings learn from
03:33:38.279 him and try to resist their you found
03:33:40.479 strength for the greater good in any
03:33:42.920 case the temptation of power gets the
03:33:45.359 better them as its maddening taint takes
03:33:48.640 hold morgot is humble even in response
03:33:52.239 to America breaking the Elden ring and
03:33:55.359 surprisingly of all his siblings it is
03:33:58.319 his twin who differs most here MOG
03:34:01.600 escapes to form his own New Order MOG
03:34:05.720 can be seen in his new ornate robes when
03:34:08.439 he steals Mika having escaped the
03:34:10.399 squalled sewers and replacing it with
03:34:12.560 the finery of his planned order a new
03:34:15.840 dynasty of blood an order he hopes will
03:34:19.239 replace the dominant order of the lands
03:34:21.680 between but morgot wants only to mend
03:34:25.160 and Aid the Earth tree keeping his
03:34:27.439 garments and accepting his station his
03:34:30.760 other siblings are closer to Moog they
03:34:33.840 crave
03:34:35.640 power the Mad taint of their new power
03:34:38.760 infects them and they fight amongst
03:34:41.359 themselves to gain the great
03:34:44.640 runes morgot views them as
03:34:48.800 traitors traitors not to America the
03:34:51.840 mother who didn't care for him as a
03:34:53.560 child and simply put him to use as a
03:34:56.000 blade in his later life but as traitors
03:34:58.399 to the her tree and to the order itself
03:35:01.840 and as Mara wishes this to happen his
03:35:04.600 mother is a traitor to the Earth tree
03:35:07.720 too morgot decides he must protect the
03:35:10.880 her tree from being invaded and taken
03:35:13.359 over by whatever alternative order is
03:35:15.720 desired by the Victor whether it be a
03:35:18.040 bodyless witch a rotten demigod or
03:35:21.880 someone deluded enough to try and start
03:35:24.160 an entirely new
03:35:26.840 order to keep the Earth tree safe he
03:35:29.520 relies on more than his strength he
03:35:32.120 begins to rely on
03:35:34.840 illusion morgot himself was born into
03:35:38.199 hiding his whole life has been a secret
03:35:41.199 buried in the shadows he now takes this
03:35:44.359 aspect of his history and uses it marget
03:35:48.479 now becomes The Illusionist and the
03:35:52.120 illusion and if he has not received
03:35:54.680 Grace for his work with the knight's
03:35:56.479 Cavalry he receives it here when he
03:35:59.960 becomes the veiled Monarch of
03:36:04.880 lendal the name morgot rises from the
03:36:08.920 darkness not as an omen but as a king he
03:36:13.359 is given the Talisman pouch by the
03:36:15.279 finger maidens and the two fingers he is
03:36:18.479 accepted as ruler by the greater will
03:36:21.920 now that morgot is the best option the
03:36:24.080 god of the earth tree has graced him and
03:36:26.520 given him the right to rule and to the
03:36:29.080 world who has never heard the name of
03:36:30.880 Mor God he is now the king of
03:36:34.120 landal this King meets with no one in
03:36:37.279 person yet no single person apart from
03:36:40.680 morgot knows this fact they each assume
03:36:44.319 their station isn't High Enough enough
03:36:45.800 for such an honor so he creates this
03:36:48.399 Fantasy around him and while it is not a
03:36:51.399 perfect illusion some Pier it Gideon The
03:36:54.800 all- Knowing being one of them but the
03:36:57.479 knowledge of few amongst the noise of
03:36:59.960 many does not spread if it is shared at
03:37:02.800 all and most Souls of the lands between
03:37:05.880 are unaware that they are ruled over by
03:37:08.880 an omen but the greater will and the
03:37:11.760 Earth tree are just as ruthless as ever
03:37:15.040 just as no blessings were wasted on morg
03:37:17.160 Go's birth neither does the greater will
03:37:19.600 gift any more here than is absolutely
03:37:22.239 necessary he may be Monarch but he is
03:37:25.479 not Elden Lord he is still an
03:37:29.520 omen an omen cannot re-enter into the
03:37:32.840 system such a folding could corrupt the
03:37:35.359 order entire creating aox upon life
03:37:39.680 itself he is no true king and blood
03:37:43.760 hound Knight flaw knows
03:37:46.560 FL continues his wait for a true king to
03:37:50.800 serve the Earth tree rejects morgot
03:37:53.960 remaining blocked by Thorns he would
03:37:56.359 only enter to restore things as best he
03:37:58.800 can but even this is met with failure
03:38:02.399 despite this he does not stop loving the
03:38:04.479 Earth tree and continues his duty and
03:38:07.840 his duty is protection as a steward
03:38:11.199 protection of the earth tree against the
03:38:13.960 traitors he defends lendelle in an
03:38:16.680 allout wall leand Del's second defense
03:38:19.840 stacking High the corpses of his enemies
03:38:23.120 the wall is never breached he fights
03:38:26.080 back radan the lion of the battlefield
03:38:28.640 and the Conqueror of the stars as marget
03:38:31.319 and the wall is still unbreached Melania
03:38:34.760 may be undefeated but she never
03:38:36.880 challenged morod and no demigod succeeds
03:38:40.080 in entering the capital the wall is
03:38:42.600 unbreached to this day
03:38:45.920 and he doesn't just defend he takes
03:38:48.479 actions against heresy and those
03:38:50.680 attempting to undermine the erre system
03:38:53.199 he sends his troops to attack the
03:38:54.960 volcano Mana laying Siege upon it until
03:38:57.680 even those faithful to Reichard regret
03:39:00.319 ever
03:39:01.239 rebelling all this time he makes sure to
03:39:03.960 Cull any traitors tarnished or Champions
03:39:07.000 who have Ambitions for Elden lordship he
03:39:10.279 calls Mighty Heroes to join his ranks
03:39:12.880 accepting many who have been outcast in
03:39:14.960 the past
03:39:16.199 banished or not he needs strength in
03:39:18.479 this chaos of the shattering we know he
03:39:21.000 called envil a banished Knight who
03:39:23.399 rejected marget to watch over a
03:39:25.399 masterless castle and he called banished
03:39:28.399 Knight Oleg who took up the call undoing
03:39:31.359 his banishment he killed a 100 traitors
03:39:34.279 under marget and earned the honor of an
03:39:36.640 her tree burial he gives their actions
03:39:39.800 just reward and once again this is the
03:39:42.520 conduct of a lord as he gifts what he
03:39:45.600 himself will never be permitted an her
03:39:48.800 tree burial but his ruthless service to
03:39:51.840 the order his unwavering fixation on
03:39:54.680 what is best for the her tree leads to
03:39:57.239 other more severe
03:39:59.520 decisions for it is not only those who
03:40:02.199 were banished that morgot accepts during
03:40:04.920 the war he uses his own kind he had
03:40:09.399 forgotten the Royal Omens below the
03:40:11.920 capital his freedom did not grant them
03:40:15.040 their
03:40:16.239 but now more unkind than this neglect he
03:40:19.720 uses Omens as weapons of war he cannot
03:40:23.600 have pity for them he cannot lose this
03:40:26.319 war just as the greater will spares no
03:40:28.920 expense on morgot for the sake of the
03:40:30.800 order this harshness goes down the chain
03:40:34.279 morgot wastes nothing on the omen he
03:40:37.640 sends them into battle as Brute Force
03:40:40.199 Warriors he Awards them Cleavers a tool
03:40:43.120 of War made to take advantage of brute
03:40:45.840 untrained strength these weapons blister
03:40:48.840 the hands that wield them as they aren't
03:40:50.760 even equipped with a handle and in a
03:40:53.359 final insult showing the Lord's mistrust
03:40:56.199 of his own kind they are cursed to break
03:41:00.960 this ruler wouldn't want Omen causing
03:41:03.080 trouble once the fighting is over armed
03:41:05.800 with a Cleaver they could become trouble
03:41:07.840 for the capital's Omen killers in the
03:41:10.880 lands between perfumers the Healer
03:41:14.000 Trisha and perhaps even fear are kinder
03:41:17.439 to Omens than morot
03:41:20.040 is but we shouldn't speak too soon after
03:41:23.840 all Trisha fails to help the Omens and
03:41:27.120 morgar understands the omen curse better
03:41:31.319 than anyone morgot does whatever it
03:41:34.880 takes and he succeeds no traitor gains
03:41:38.479 power while the fell Omen and His Hands
03:41:40.920 roam the lands between and he manages
03:41:43.920 all of this while while ruling as a king
03:41:47.000 while carrying out the battlefield
03:41:48.760 victories as marget still wearing his
03:41:51.479 rags and ensuring the running of the
03:41:53.720 capital as morgot who has traded the
03:41:56.199 Shadows of the depths for the Shadows
03:41:58.800 cast by
03:41:59.960 statecraft he tirelessly defends to this
03:42:03.000 day until he defends his ER tree against
03:42:07.920 us the first Rune a tarist usually seeks
03:42:11.279 is the Rune of godric the grafted or as
03:42:14.439 morot resp respectfully calls him godri
03:42:17.199 the
03:42:17.960 golden morgot materializes with golden
03:42:21.040 magic to block our journey to his
03:42:23.159 relative to our first great Rune he has
03:42:26.640 kept his identity separate and we will
03:42:28.920 not know we have met the ruler of
03:42:30.920 leandel until much later he wastes no
03:42:34.800 courtesy on greeting us mocking our
03:42:37.239 ignorance and how easily we are led by
03:42:39.840 others the hunt for Glory the flame of
03:42:43.040 ambition inside us makes us Rush
03:42:45.439 headlong into a world we do not
03:42:48.080 understand he does not respect this
03:42:50.960 attitude even in the fight we can see a
03:42:53.640 glimpse of who he really is a lord of
03:42:56.720 Illusion making Mighty gold hammers out
03:42:59.279 of the air that disappear an instant
03:43:01.920 later he himself disappears after the
03:43:04.960 fight his death yet another trick his
03:43:08.600 voice on the Wind warns us of the hands
03:43:11.680 of the fell Omen the hands of the fell
03:43:15.159 fell Omen shall Brook thee No
03:43:19.680 Quarter the knight's Cavalry still Roam
03:43:23.080 and will kill us if they find
03:43:25.880 us later as we come closer to his
03:43:28.920 Capital he uses the body of an old
03:43:31.840 wandering Noble he possesses this body
03:43:35.080 with golden magic from the time of his
03:43:37.319 birth the symbol of The
03:43:39.760 Crucible on defeat he departs again the
03:43:43.479 corpse of the man left behind mind used
03:43:46.359 and discarded just like the troops and
03:43:49.640 doens in the
03:43:51.560 shattering finally we meet him in flesh
03:43:54.560 and blood at the entrance of the earth
03:43:57.399 tree the spirit-like golden Thrones are
03:44:01.319 glowing morot must know that for us to
03:44:04.399 be here many of those who ought to sit
03:44:06.640 on these Thrones are dead he does not
03:44:09.960 mention his twin but the others for him
03:44:13.680 they are all TR ERS and he does not
03:44:16.920 mourn them he greets us as pillagers and
03:44:20.560 he is not wrong we have taken every run
03:44:23.359 we possess by
03:44:25.080 force he prepares to fight us for the
03:44:28.000 third time revealing yet another
03:44:30.840 illusion his walking stick and staff is
03:44:34.120 in fact his accursed blood that he
03:44:36.399 recanted resealed into a blade it's
03:44:40.120 shifting Hues and Natures showing all
03:44:42.880 the natures within an omen growing from
03:44:45.720 within them torturing them he fights
03:44:48.720 with the strength expected from someone
03:44:50.840 who is never known defeat until his
03:44:54.319 strength begins to fail and the grace of
03:44:58.000 gold he was granted breaks his blood is
03:45:02.359 unsealed mixing into its Omen chaos
03:45:05.840 staining the Thrones his Omen Hues have
03:45:09.640 no place here morgot is ashamed of
03:45:12.399 himself but he is even more ashamed of
03:45:15.560 his curse this Twisted era of life
03:45:19.040 itself he promises he will never forget
03:45:22.199 our part in this he has Stained the
03:45:25.279 Thrones right beneath the Earth
03:45:28.000 tree but it ends an empty threat finally
03:45:33.439 morot
03:45:35.399 Falls the greater will does not save him
03:45:38.520 for in the great scheme of things there
03:45:40.560 is no reason to on death his Omen
03:45:44.000 features seem to leave him and his human
03:45:47.040 Essence is Left To Die he can barely
03:45:50.640 speak but tells us we shall share the
03:45:53.399 same fate as him that we are destined to
03:45:57.319 fail th Deeds shall be met with
03:46:02.239 failure just as
03:46:05.000 I failure the shadow of his birth that
03:46:08.960 has never left him it comes to take him
03:46:12.000 now in his final defeat
03:46:15.040 the only person with any pity for morgot
03:46:17.760 the only one to mourn him is his father
03:46:21.319 the veiled Monarch was an illusion so no
03:46:24.359 one knows when he passes away the body
03:46:27.600 of morgot lel's King now human and
03:46:31.359 Beyond shame is left at the foot of the
03:46:34.159 earth tree no one notices no one in the
03:46:37.640 capital even stumbles upon their
03:46:39.720 thankless King morgot knew he could not
03:46:43.080 have an her tree burial but he has not
03:46:45.359 even offered the Dignity of a standard
03:46:47.520 one instead he is found by Godfrey who
03:46:51.199 cradles his son with tenderness sarash
03:46:54.720 Roars while Godfrey maintains his
03:46:57.720 composure morgot then Fades away and
03:47:01.359 whatever is left becomes the guidance of
03:47:05.279 Grace the greater will uses morot once
03:47:08.600 more as motivation for Godfree in battle
03:47:12.199 a means to an end
03:47:15.840 morgot succeeded as a tool for others
03:47:18.640 and as a shield for the Earth
03:47:21.260 [Music]
03:47:22.880 tree but it was always marica's aims the
03:47:26.840 greater Wills plans our Ambitions that
03:47:30.520 succeeded in the
03:47:33.120 end morgot may never have been given a
03:47:36.239 true Victory but there was never a more
03:47:39.000 true servant of the UR tree or one who
03:47:42.520 loved it more
03:47:45.359 morat's actions were not saintly he uses
03:47:49.040 his soldiers as tools he deceives his
03:47:51.960 own people and until death he sanctions
03:47:55.560 Omen Killers why would he do this when
03:47:58.319 he has lived a life as an omen when he
03:48:01.159 knows its torture he does not abolish
03:48:03.800 this cult Because he believes Omens will
03:48:06.159 harm the order of the earth tree and he
03:48:08.560 will not let compassion ambition
03:48:11.680 loathing or anything hinder his servant
03:48:16.159 does morot inspire love does he deserve
03:48:19.600 respect if the Omens were free would
03:48:22.479 they forgive him were his actions
03:48:25.159 worthwhile or did they amount to nothing
03:48:27.960 but a
03:48:29.159 delay we can be certain that morgot held
03:48:32.560 absolutely to his principles he did not
03:48:35.560 decide to spite the world for the way it
03:48:37.920 treated him he kept faith and did his
03:48:40.960 duty to the end he hid himself from
03:48:44.159 those who would not accept him he
03:48:46.479 forgave those who abandoned him and he
03:48:49.560 loved and protected what always rejected
03:48:53.319 him does the Ury Grant him one blessing
03:48:56.600 in the end a true death and escape from
03:49:00.439 suffering if this is a kindness like
03:49:03.439 everything the greater will has ever
03:49:05.199 granted more God it is a cheap
03:49:08.720 one to live a life like more Gods would
03:49:11.840 make it so easy to turn to despair and
03:49:15.720 spite to end up thinking what does it
03:49:19.040 matter then if the curse claims it all
03:49:23.199 but morgot rises above his
03:49:26.239 circumstance The Omen Helm asks the
03:49:29.640 heart of an omen without the body to
03:49:31.960 match could there be any cruler
03:49:36.080 existence there is one it's opposite the
03:49:40.880 heart of a lord with the body of a omen
03:49:45.479 and morgot lived this existence With
03:49:59.159 Honor a door
03:50:02.880 opens and for the first time we walk
03:50:06.000 into Lim grave a miracle tow over us
03:50:09.720 gold and almost
03:50:12.600 seethrough could we touch it feel it
03:50:15.600 beneath our
03:50:16.700 [Music]
03:50:20.199 hand to find out means passing through
03:50:23.000 its living ramparts the earthree
03:50:25.359 Sentinels this mounted Knight is clad in
03:50:27.920 nigh unbreakable gold and blessed by the
03:50:30.760 grace of old this boss defends to the
03:50:33.439 death what we only reach at the end of a
03:50:35.560 long
03:50:37.279 Quest a tree that Still Remains a
03:50:40.960 mystery so why why send this Defender
03:50:44.800 all the way out here if all Defenders of
03:50:47.080 the earth tree aspire to be like this
03:50:49.199 Warrior why TK this Warrior to fight us
03:50:55.080 now because we are a tarnished with
03:50:59.880 vision the Earth Trey does not fear how
03:51:02.399 close you are or your strength or an axe
03:51:05.680 the greatest threat to the Earth tree is
03:51:07.760 those blessed with a
03:51:10.399 vision of what could be
03:51:15.640 and a lowly tarnished blessed with
03:51:17.800 vision is a dangerous thing indeed for
03:51:20.720 the seed of an idea can bring a world of
03:51:27.399 change for like all trees the Earth tree
03:51:30.720 can grow too large its bowels may snap
03:51:34.040 under its own weight it may be blown
03:51:36.319 down by storms and if the energies of
03:51:38.800 Life are ever lacking dead wood will
03:51:41.399 spread dead dry wood that can catch a
03:51:45.279 flame at the slightest
03:51:48.880 spark but if it burns what Remains What
03:51:53.080 is the earth tree what do its symbols
03:51:55.680 mean and why is this miracle both real
03:51:59.199 and unreal you'll want to watch this
03:52:01.920 documentary to the end because there are
03:52:04.000 some world first law reveals in this
03:52:11.120 one long before the Earth tree exists as
03:52:14.040 we see it today there was life this life
03:52:17.159 arose from the chaos of the world and
03:52:20.080 from its
03:52:21.470 [Music]
03:52:23.840 order life exists by both of these Ki of
03:52:27.279 nature life cannot live in total order
03:52:30.840 life is defined by change it cannot live
03:52:33.800 in total chaos it is defined by how it
03:52:36.600 does not change and all life has
03:52:39.439 connections to All
03:52:41.520 Things the wolf connects to the deer but
03:52:44.960 also through the deer to the river and
03:52:47.880 to the ant all things are connected like
03:52:51.040 a tangle of endless threads and these
03:52:53.600 threads of Life exist in all possible
03:52:56.120 relations food shelter
03:53:00.319 Recreation life and death like a great
03:53:03.920 web as though all of life from Every
03:53:06.760 Creature to every inch of soil was
03:53:09.239 threaded through the roots of nature
03:53:12.000 like the roots of a tree of life as life
03:53:15.159 goes on the roots of Life grow and
03:53:17.399 multiply their connections increase and
03:53:20.080 fold these roots are as real as the
03:53:22.680 realities of the Jungle realities which
03:53:25.120 Run Deep they are the essentials no life
03:53:28.600 could exist without them
03:53:31.000 heat
03:53:32.800 cold pain
03:53:36.680 pleasure
03:53:38.680 hunger
03:53:40.239 food
03:53:42.239 energy life
03:53:44.920 and
03:53:46.600 death to sustain life means having the
03:53:49.439 tools to navigate all of these things
03:53:52.080 and some tools are absolutely necessary
03:53:55.199 as life goes on the roots of Life
03:53:57.000 continue to become more complex the wolf
03:53:59.920 cannot over hunt except to risk its own
03:54:02.720 Extinction the adult must protect its
03:54:05.319 child or risk Extinction and the
03:54:07.920 participants in life must compete or
03:54:10.600 risk Extinction each life has its time
03:54:13.920 but death brings nourishment and space
03:54:16.600 for New Life these Basics are shared
03:54:19.000 across all life as roots and these roots
03:54:22.399 connect in the tree of life the tree
03:54:25.319 emerges naturally yet defines life with
03:54:28.319 such beauty it seems to be crafted by
03:54:30.920 the gods just as the stars in their
03:54:33.199 orbits form order from chaos the Tree of
03:54:36.000 Life arises without any living mind
03:54:38.560 directing it in time life gathers around
03:54:41.560 the tree to worship it a miracle rooted
03:54:44.439 in the ground a miracle that brings the
03:54:46.680 Bounty of life and the blessing of
03:54:51.080 death and all that passes between them
03:54:54.040 to Every Creature for no creature alone
03:54:57.120 could
03:54:58.560 survive and so the tree is worshiped by
03:55:01.680 all this is the great tree the original
03:55:05.120 golden
03:55:08.960 tree death is in the roots of this tree
03:55:11.880 just as life is the roots are in many
03:55:14.680 spirals of opposites the roots are an
03:55:17.680 endless Paradox but that is why life is
03:55:21.080 a miracle life goes on and early life
03:55:24.239 can barely manage to survive let alone
03:55:26.960 change the world but with Time Life can
03:55:29.920 influence its surroundings more slowly
03:55:33.279 life could change the world that built
03:55:35.159 it if only a little whether that was a
03:55:38.120 nest or a tunnel the basic creatures of
03:55:41.120 life could impose their own order and
03:55:44.040 this increased as they competed change
03:55:47.000 came faster and faster as though the
03:55:49.520 basic forms of life began crawling on
03:55:52.080 their belly like a snake and now grew
03:55:55.399 hands and more than gripping with hands
03:55:58.760 they also grew Minds with which they
03:56:00.840 could grip much more fingers claws hands
03:56:05.560 Minds all competed in the Furness that
03:56:08.760 was early
03:56:10.960 life strength lust paren Instinct hunger
03:56:16.359 every tool of survival was essential and
03:56:19.000 these beginnings of Life today were like
03:56:20.920 a crucible that forged life itself every
03:56:24.640 living being fought in the heat of
03:56:26.960 competition and under the law of the
03:56:29.080 Jungle beasts
03:56:32.000 rule certain life forms succeeded some
03:56:36.000 died out some became numerous and some
03:56:40.960 scarce and the Tree of Life grew larger
03:56:44.600 even as it shared a bow or a branch
03:56:47.520 others grew and new buds sprouted and
03:56:50.960 the sun indiscriminate energy given to
03:56:53.680 all who competed for it bathed the Tree
03:56:56.840 of Life each living thing was like a
03:57:00.199 leaf competing for the
03:57:03.159 sun each Leaf fed the tree and each Leaf
03:57:06.680 was fed by the tree by the blind
03:57:09.120 decisions of nature the roots of the
03:57:11.520 world the tree was formed by no mind in
03:57:15.080 some living beings the grip of the Mind
03:57:17.439 grew even more the Beast mind was beset
03:57:20.880 by its Instincts by its desires but
03:57:23.920 intelligence gave greater insight and
03:57:26.800 vision could see another possibility
03:57:29.720 adaptation not of one's being but of the
03:57:32.800 outside world Beyond a mere nest in time
03:57:37.399 the scope of this realization grew until
03:57:40.159 it was understood that a plant can be
03:57:42.840 trained nature is flexible the currents
03:57:46.880 of life can be directed if we understand
03:57:49.399 them and so the tree was cut down to
03:57:53.199 regrow it a
03:57:58.120 new leaving a
03:58:01.439 trunk with new
03:58:03.960 shoots but this time we were Gardeners
03:58:06.880 of our own destiny another Crucible of
03:58:10.199 competition formed but now there would
03:58:12.800 be a guiding hand
03:58:15.279 life Cannot Be Tamed entirely but it can
03:58:17.960 be
03:58:18.920 directed and in this new furnace the
03:58:21.560 Beast of life would form something new
03:58:24.439 something different fed by the blood of
03:58:27.600 competition life and death and the great
03:58:30.600 struggle to survive they would form
03:58:33.159 something that just like the pot boys
03:58:35.760 may be better than its
03:58:37.960 innards for the Earth tree is miyazaki's
03:58:41.520 representation of society a great tree
03:58:45.040 that everyone is blessed by everyone can
03:58:47.800 be safe in its shelter blessed by its
03:58:50.840 creations and yet each member must
03:58:53.600 sacrifice some of their energy some of
03:58:56.120 their nature some of their soul the
03:58:59.159 storms of nature must
03:59:01.760 quiet and those who would threaten the
03:59:04.120 stability must be defeated in
03:59:07.439 war but in the lands between the systems
03:59:10.520 of society its structures and its
03:59:12.920 Dynamics are much more than in our world
03:59:16.159 the urry and Elden ring directs the
03:59:18.399 vital energies of life itself such as
03:59:21.520 the power of this new
03:59:23.640 age the beginning of this new age is
03:59:26.159 still tainted red the Crimson of the
03:59:28.760 time of the beasts of jungle law still
03:59:31.960 glows it is revered as an ancient
03:59:34.600 Holiness the holy power of nature that
03:59:37.199 brought survival abundance and even
03:59:40.640 surprisingly Society itself after all
03:59:44.279 this new tree is still connected to the
03:59:46.120 roots of old the miracle rooted in the
03:59:49.120 ground and it is no coincidence it
03:59:52.239 couldn't live without these roots it is
03:59:54.920 just the tree at top the roots that has
03:59:56.800 been tamed altered to serve its time the
04:00:00.640 roots are much more vast and fixed than
04:00:03.239 the tree and so the early stages of the
04:00:06.080 earth tree is marked by this Taming of
04:00:08.840 life like the early taming force of
04:00:11.439 society
04:00:14.199 life pushes through willfully defying
04:00:17.080 the order of this new age creatures show
04:00:19.920 the closeness to the wild world in their
04:00:22.159 own flesh a sign of how close the border
04:00:25.239 to the wild still is most importantly
04:00:28.239 for this age the fires of instinct must
04:00:30.800 be cooled they could burn the whole
04:00:33.279 thing
04:00:34.399 down the snakes of lust violence Envy
04:00:38.760 must be beaten back and driven from the
04:00:41.359 sight of the tree for those in society
04:00:44.239 use hands not fangs they use Reason Not
04:00:48.279 aggression and snakes just like fire are
04:00:51.720 what may betray the Earth tree to its
04:00:54.399 ruin Guardians would watch over these
04:00:56.880 potential traitors to the Earth tree
04:00:59.399 fires of ourselves that could never
04:01:01.439 truly be put out despite being forbidden
04:01:05.080 they would always tempt those closest to
04:01:08.560 them the tree now reaches across Plains
04:01:12.840 from death to
04:01:15.000 life to
04:01:17.000 Spirit from the underworld to Earth to
04:01:21.399 Heaven from the world of fundamentals to
04:01:24.600 the regulating mind to the pure world of
04:01:29.000 ideas from the deep past to the present
04:01:33.279 to the possible future and as the tree
04:01:36.080 grows it will strive to reach heaven to
04:01:39.279 reach ideals to become taller more
04:01:42.720 golden to even take
04:01:47.560 flight and for a time this great dream
04:01:50.880 progresses members of society are
04:01:53.199 numerous and like leaves they feed the
04:01:55.720 tree they sacrifice a little of
04:01:58.120 themselves in service to the tree and in
04:02:00.720 turn are fed by the
04:02:02.600 tree the Earth tree is not just a
04:02:05.040 parasite it is a
04:02:07.040 relationship just as we give some of
04:02:09.120 ourselves to it so are we protected by
04:02:11.960 the society in turn we sacrifice
04:02:14.960 together so that we can become more than
04:02:16.880 the sum of our part and some in society
04:02:20.040 are not leaves but
04:02:23.120 branches and some are even bows and just
04:02:26.960 as in our society some hold the power to
04:02:29.479 direct what gives energy and what takes
04:02:32.199 it away those in power of the earthree
04:02:35.279 direct the energies of life itself they
04:02:38.120 literally give the blessings of Life
04:02:40.720 Distributing life's raw Necessities to
04:02:43.239 the faithful rewarding those who serve
04:02:45.680 Society with most Vivid
04:02:48.479 coloration lives are no longer spent in
04:02:51.199 service of oneself but in service of all
04:02:54.800 in service of the earth tree this action
04:02:57.600 is the soul of a hero even death is no
04:03:00.960 longer the domain of Decay or of fire
04:03:04.040 but of the tree the nourishment of death
04:03:06.920 that HS for countless ages returned
04:03:09.040 haphazardly to Nature now returns to the
04:03:12.040 tree in an ordered way
04:03:14.560 and this is done willingly such as the
04:03:17.359 faith in the earth tree for this Society
04:03:20.199 doesn't just take and return energy
04:03:22.520 during each Leaf's life but will take it
04:03:25.239 on death and direct this energy to where
04:03:27.760 it sees fit for the Earth tree doesn't
04:03:30.399 make the energy for life it directs it
04:03:33.760 forms it orders it the Earth tree
04:03:37.120 started with a vision the vision of
04:03:39.920 those blessed with sight became a
04:03:41.960 reality through struggle this new
04:03:44.319 Society begins to also establish Itself
04:03:46.960 by diplomacy a part of its growing
04:03:49.600 toolkit War Masters would now have to
04:03:52.560 act as a
04:03:54.279 Lord but change leaves many behind and
04:03:58.479 some could see purpose for themselves in
04:04:00.359 this changing world and some did not
04:04:03.640 with the departure from the old world
04:04:05.800 some had the light in their eyes fade
04:04:08.760 the path to take became unclear and the
04:04:11.760 motivation to follow the path was was
04:04:14.040 barely a light but some could see the
04:04:16.960 path to a new era not all were graced
04:04:20.000 with sight but enough were and enough
04:04:23.239 followed them and the world changed the
04:04:26.680 age brought honor
04:04:29.159 ethics
04:04:30.960 courtesy sacrifice virtue the values of
04:04:35.239 culture would bind all of its members
04:04:37.920 just as a great river that nourishes
04:04:40.159 those who live near it so began the era
04:04:44.439 of
04:04:45.920 abundance like so much in society that
04:04:48.880 does not exist and yet brings its
04:04:51.080 greatest abundance faith in the UR tree
04:04:54.159 brought this era into life Faith that
04:04:57.560 giving would return more faith that
04:05:00.399 self-sacrifice would bring more than the
04:05:02.439 gains of shallow competition just as in
04:05:05.120 our world so much that cannot be held
04:05:07.640 physically the law culture currency
04:05:11.600 rights it is shared ideas and beliefs
04:05:14.840 that are worth more than gold to uproot
04:05:18.120 them would be a terrible fate indeed and
04:05:21.479 yet individually all of us give
04:05:23.760 sacrifice to these things the Earth
04:05:26.800 tre's roots are physical but much of the
04:05:29.720 Earth tree is an illusion but an
04:05:32.239 illusion can have more Force than what
04:05:34.720 is merely physical when up close to the
04:05:37.319 Earth tree the reality of its benefits
04:05:39.600 are undeniable it is solid gold far away
04:05:44.159 from its influence it fades and almost
04:05:48.720 disappears lost faith causes it to fade
04:05:52.479 and should everyone lose faith it
04:05:54.640 disappears entirely just like the grand
04:05:58.199 golden Illusions in our world graced by
04:06:01.239 the Earth tree life flourishes like
04:06:03.760 never before the blessings are poured on
04:06:06.479 the faithful like a bountiful River to
04:06:09.239 defend the Earth tree is an honor to
04:06:11.760 serve it is a privilege the elixir of
04:06:14.720 Life runs bright sap courses through its
04:06:18.040 bowels its greatest treasure these
04:06:20.960 resources are now centralized the chaos
04:06:24.399 and friction that was like a leaky
04:06:26.479 bucket is now sealed Away by coming
04:06:29.120 together the Bounty of gold was
04:06:31.479 reflected in the wheat of the great
04:06:33.640 harvests with abundance more and more
04:06:36.520 begin to see a lighted path Grace begets
04:06:40.359 Grace more and more were blessed in a
04:06:43.159 virt cycle more could see the great gold
04:06:46.640 tree towering over a miracle a
04:06:49.800 collective Miracle of every member and
04:06:52.720 the leaders accepted their solemn Duty a
04:06:55.520 blessing they would gladly bear forever
04:06:58.760 all did their Duty from Leaf to Bow this
04:07:02.680 Sacrifice from the rulers who chose to
04:07:04.960 serve to those who milled the grain
04:07:07.560 meant this age would be long remembered
04:07:10.239 those who did great Deeds for society
04:07:12.600 would be honored by and her tree burial
04:07:15.359 their Essence feeding the tree much more
04:07:17.399 than others thanks to this proximity
04:07:20.000 just as they had influenced the tree
04:07:21.479 deeply in their life a desire for the
04:07:24.439 future a motivation to achieve it a
04:07:27.720 vision of what's possible fueled this
04:07:30.439 era an era of Plenty but all youth is
04:07:35.080 for a fleeting
04:07:38.359 moment nature's first green is gold
04:07:43.720 her hardest Hue to
04:07:47.000 hold her early leaves are
04:07:50.359 flower but only so an
04:07:54.159 hour then Leaf subsides to
04:07:57.600 Leaf so Eden sank to
04:08:01.119 grief so Dawn goes down
04:08:04.520 today Nothing Gold Can
04:08:08.060 [Music]
04:08:09.840 Stay ambition flourishes in abundance
04:08:13.560 the tree has grown so tall surely the
04:08:16.000 tree can grow taller still but ambition
04:08:18.840 can trip on itself the heights we hope
04:08:21.760 to reach in the future can be dangerous
04:08:23.840 if you ignore the depths of the past for
04:08:26.600 the traitor to the Earth tree still
04:08:28.479 lives in the roots and centralization
04:08:31.840 Order and control brings abundance but
04:08:34.680 it also brings Temptation the snake of
04:08:37.479 greed is tamed but not killed it lives
04:08:40.960 inside of those who Mill the grain just
04:08:43.560 as it lives in their
04:08:45.159 leaders the Ury found its success early
04:08:48.680 but it took time to discover its risks
04:08:51.680 the benefits from control are enormous
04:08:54.279 but the wisdom of mind is different to
04:08:56.359 the wisdom of Nature and not always
04:08:59.040 better nature for all its chaos doesn't
04:09:02.319 forget anyone no one is lost in the
04:09:05.399 filing nature is ruthless but not
04:09:09.319 bureaucratic as the branches grow and
04:09:11.880 grow in the tree of life it can grow
04:09:14.199 beyond the management of its own
04:09:16.279 gardeners branches will be neglected and
04:09:19.479 die for no good reason other than bad
04:09:22.239 luck those who suffer this cruel fate
04:09:25.040 resent the tree and its Keepers and may
04:09:27.840 wish for a return of the law of nature
04:09:30.880 worse than this those with the power to
04:09:33.080 control the flow of life may become
04:09:35.239 fickle when deciding who deserves to be
04:09:37.680 blessed the life that does not conform
04:09:40.119 to an Ever tightening definition is cast
04:09:42.800 out
04:09:43.840 left with less and less faithfuls to
04:09:46.279 sustain the tree it
04:09:48.880 fades growing higher and further from
04:09:51.520 the roots brought great abundance but it
04:09:54.040 also brought a great forgetting the
04:09:56.600 roots of the tree are far below the
04:09:58.680 leaves now the leaves bathe in Gold the
04:10:02.159 roots of Nature and its wild confusing
04:10:05.159 coils have been disregarded for a good
04:10:07.600 long while the roots are still at work
04:10:10.600 they are just more hidden the hero of
04:10:13.239 the the Earth tree is still driven by
04:10:15.560 Pride the careful worded Diplomat is
04:10:18.399 still competing lust and greed still
04:10:21.119 exist they are just at work quietly but
04:10:24.399 the fresh leaves are so nourished in the
04:10:26.520 gold and rarified air of the Tall Tree
04:10:29.560 they cannot believe the roots could be
04:10:31.439 full of snakes the foliage is bright and
04:10:34.439 the roots are hidden
04:10:36.000 underground and abundance after all
04:10:38.760 brings a lack of worldly wisdom more
04:10:41.880 serpents there are the ash than an
04:10:44.640 unwise ape would think there can't
04:10:47.840 really be snakes within us after all it
04:10:50.640 is mere
04:10:53.040 myth the Earth tree Society sees Grace
04:10:56.239 extending up higher as though the Earth
04:10:58.560 tree could take flight as though we
04:11:00.880 could live in the heavens as Angels just
04:11:03.840 like the tree perhaps we too could
04:11:06.319 become spiritual gold we could transcend
04:11:09.680 our vulgar
04:11:11.080 roots and so the society turns its hands
04:11:14.319 upon itself once more to influence what
04:11:17.479 before was viewed as unchanging now the
04:11:20.800 Earth Tre seals the cycles of life and
04:11:23.520 death and all the mess that drives
04:11:26.760 it now birth and death would be
04:11:29.760 controlled by the same people who
04:11:31.680 delivered life's Bounty there would be
04:11:34.359 no abundance or space given by death it
04:11:37.800 would be managed while these new changes
04:11:40.640 are believed to be a sign of great
04:11:42.319 progress by many
04:11:44.000 some have doubts some faithful see in
04:11:47.279 their dreams the neglected Roots leading
04:11:50.199 the tree to wither they see faithful
04:11:52.880 Believers in the tree becoming
04:11:54.359 disillusioned as the Bounty is
04:11:56.080 squandered by foolishness they see poor
04:11:58.920 choices made to follow a false path the
04:12:02.560 prophets see the tree becoming dry and
04:12:04.920 brittle as it misunderstands itself they
04:12:07.800 see it becoming like Tinder ready to
04:12:10.279 light at the slightest spark they see
04:12:12.680 the tree burst into flames in their
04:12:14.560 dreams and they weep for the most
04:12:17.199 faithful see grace most clearly they see
04:12:20.399 the dangers first and want more than
04:12:23.159 anyone to prevent the wrong path being
04:12:25.560 taken but to share this Vision means
04:12:28.040 only to be driven from your home and
04:12:32.439 banished these prophecies cannot be
04:12:34.760 shared in civilized company to mention
04:12:37.640 the roots is bad enough but to say we
04:12:39.960 should respect these roots is almost
04:12:42.479 evil such beliefs are vulgar and have no
04:12:45.680 place here as part of a tree that most
04:12:47.840 believe can perfect itself and so those
04:12:51.159 who love the tree most are cast out
04:12:54.359 despite this more and more have doubts
04:12:56.880 as to the reality of the tree reaching
04:12:58.880 the
04:12:59.560 heavens The Gift of Sight grows murky to
04:13:02.720 many some cannot see a Guiding Light and
04:13:05.960 amongst all these ideal Futures there
04:13:08.560 are more and more neglected leaves on
04:13:10.640 the tree but there is something yet get
04:13:13.359 worse the bureaucracy of a Leader's Duty
04:13:16.840 begins to reveal itself it now weighs as
04:13:20.000 a Goring curse from which there is no
04:13:22.960 Deliverance perfect choices are
04:13:25.279 impossible and many are unhappy no
04:13:27.760 matter what choices made the leaders
04:13:30.319 begin to feel it is a thankless task
04:13:33.319 that they deserve more and by this time
04:13:36.080 the leaders have realized a new
04:13:37.960 possibility deliver me unto Greater
04:13:41.880 Heights
04:13:43.520 as the stewards of Life they can tap
04:13:45.760 this resource for their own ends what is
04:13:49.239 a little here and there in the grand
04:13:51.439 scheme of things the tree is so vast and
04:13:55.159 a Leader's Duty such a mighty sacrifice
04:13:58.439 a little extra of their pains is
04:14:00.439 Justified after all alas every age it
04:14:05.000 seems is Tainted by the greed of men a
04:14:09.279 little skimming grows to a lot and a
04:14:11.960 Fickle leader will take as much as the
04:14:14.279 faith in them allows I command thee
04:14:19.640 now I am the Lord of all that is
04:14:26.680 golden and so the fallen leaves tell a
04:14:30.680 story only the leaves closest to the
04:14:33.399 seat of rule are still golden but many
04:14:36.680 other leaves are brown and falling the
04:14:39.960 tree cannot sustain itself and as more
04:14:42.720 and more more leaves are neglected the
04:14:44.960 tree grows into its Autumn the leaves
04:14:48.159 are becoming
04:14:50.000 dry those neglected by the earthree
04:14:52.640 society are hurt resentful and ready to
04:14:56.439 rise
04:14:57.680 up and those well protected under the
04:15:00.439 trees canopy are vulnerable to Flame for
04:15:04.159 those unaware flame lives within them
04:15:06.680 are ill prepared for its
04:15:09.520 burn few could talk without banishment
04:15:12.640 but some took action in other ways some
04:15:15.520 who saw the Earth tre's foolishness
04:15:17.399 captured their thoughts wordlessly in
04:15:20.080 art an artist looking upon a now
04:15:22.760 delusional her tree called his painting
04:15:26.000 flightless bird the artist knew we are
04:15:29.080 of the earth more Snake than dragon and
04:15:32.279 the artist also knew that to try to
04:15:34.319 reach Perfection when it wasn't possible
04:15:36.800 brought ruin for what is the reward for
04:15:39.600 finding the Flightless Bird Painting
04:15:43.040 Fire's deadly sin the prophet despaired
04:15:46.840 looking up at the Earth tree for soon
04:15:49.800 the kindling would burst into flame
04:15:52.479 bringing ruin some who were upset with
04:15:55.520 how the Earth tree fiddled with the
04:15:57.000 Marvel of nature left to start new
04:16:00.080 societies The ancestral moved to live
04:16:02.600 far from the earthree they formed their
04:16:05.080 own culture they trust in the wisdom of
04:16:07.720 Nature and do not try to outdo it as the
04:16:10.359 Earth tree did many are is Enchanted by
04:16:13.880 the miracle tree they barely see its
04:16:16.279 gold at all its sap ceases to drip and
04:16:20.080 it becomes merely an object of Faith
04:16:23.239 some turn away from their Homeland
04:16:25.159 towards pagan gods gods of lust violence
04:16:29.640 greed and
04:16:31.800 gluttony even just beside the capital's
04:16:34.399 walls the old windmills that ground the
04:16:36.640 Harvest are tattered villagers who once
04:16:39.279 took in the grain now turn to the snake
04:16:42.119 and to fire
04:16:43.880 first they skin their men just as a
04:16:46.000 snake sheds its skin to renew itself and
04:16:48.920 then they burn their bodies they do this
04:16:51.680 in the hope that they will be renewed
04:16:53.520 with fresh life Reborn Red and lustful
04:16:57.319 to start the Life Death cycle once again
04:17:00.119 as nature intended for they want
04:17:03.560 children far beyond this now desolate
04:17:06.159 Farmland there are bat women they were
04:17:08.960 meant to be mothers but have been warped
04:17:11.199 by time twisted by the altered Rules of
04:17:14.279 Nature now all they can do is lament
04:17:17.439 their
04:17:21.150 [Music]
04:17:25.000 fate some wish to bring back death
04:17:28.520 indiscriminate this world is in dire
04:17:31.359 need of repair and
04:17:34.080 death
04:17:35.640 indiscriminate are you prepared to
04:17:38.720 commit a cardinal sin or even like life
04:17:43.199 in death to replace the Discrimination
04:17:46.399 of the current Rule and in the heart of
04:17:49.199 the volcano is a snake Lord whose reach
04:17:52.359 is growing sent to punish pagans he
04:17:55.720 instead saw the wisdom in the snake and
04:17:58.359 gave himself to it entirely he has grown
04:18:01.640 large and he is progressing into the
04:18:04.279 next stage of Life faster than the earth
04:18:06.720 tree is progressing to heaven the tree
04:18:09.760 is flightless but the snake Lord no
04:18:12.279 longer craws only on the belly but has
04:18:14.880 grown Limbs and many fingered
04:18:19.359 hands for the UR tree will find out to
04:18:22.800 become weak with delusion is dangerous
04:18:25.760 the fundamental root of competition ever
04:18:28.680 waiting like a coiled snake will rise up
04:18:32.600 coil around its boughs and bring the her
04:18:35.600 tree down to earth much of what was
04:18:38.880 brightly colored is now tarnished and as
04:18:41.800 more tarnishes more is sent away from
04:18:44.279 the trees Grace many will no longer be
04:18:47.439 blessed through no fault of their own
04:18:50.399 the risk to the Earth tree of those
04:18:52.159 neglected tarnished is great if any were
04:18:55.239 to understand what has happened they
04:18:57.319 could turn against the tree a tarnished
04:19:01.279 of no
04:19:02.720 Renown and if one of them had Vision or
04:19:06.159 was inspired by anothers to stand before
04:19:10.359 the Elden ring
04:19:16.399 and become the Elden
04:19:22.080 Lord as with any neglected population it
04:19:25.479 is best to keep the tarnished sedated
04:19:27.680 with sleep the tarnished cannot be
04:19:29.920 killed after all but they can be kept
04:19:32.520 passive with the right
04:19:35.920 ingredients The Souls of the minor trees
04:19:38.800 named of all things snake Soul are
04:19:41.640 becoming ulcerated and sick lacking the
04:19:44.720 true motion of life and death they are
04:19:46.880 like a stagnant rotting digestive tract
04:19:50.359 twisting and coiling like an injured
04:19:52.800 serpent it is when the roots are
04:19:54.720 forgotten that they come closer than
04:19:56.920 ever it is when the house is unguarded
04:19:59.439 that the Viper creeps into the home the
04:20:02.239 order is
04:20:04.520 failing just as at the beginning of its
04:20:07.000 time now too is the border of chaos
04:20:09.800 rearing its head there are Omens that
04:20:12.880 the age is failing there are signs that
04:20:15.000 the border of chaos is coming closer the
04:20:17.840 Thorns of the old world are pushing
04:20:20.199 through this time they foretell a ruin
04:20:23.159 that the tree brought upon itself for
04:20:25.960 most long lived trees such as this its
04:20:28.840 death is caused by its own success some
04:20:32.080 faithful go on sacrificing to the tree
04:20:35.000 even if what was once a relationship is
04:20:37.359 now all too imbalanced faith in the
04:20:39.760 earth tree now looks more like a shackle
04:20:42.680 but others are growing a new conception
04:20:44.840 of how the world could be of what orders
04:20:48.040 could sustain with enough understanding
04:20:51.000 and enough influence new orders can be
04:20:54.080 created and all that is needed to create
04:20:56.720 space for them is death for the miracle
04:21:00.040 rooted in these grounds will once again
04:21:02.840 mend the world it just needs someone
04:21:05.560 with thoughts and Ambitions to just
04:21:08.279 State a rune this Rune must be possible
04:21:12.040 grounded in reality not just an
04:21:14.439 arbitrary wish and sometimes though it
04:21:17.520 is hard to believe tragedy is
04:21:20.439 sustainable some Visions may come to
04:21:22.800 pass but it is tough to know which could
04:21:25.239 exist and which are fantasies for any of
04:21:28.359 them what is always needed is someone
04:21:30.520 with the brute strength to deliver the
04:21:32.560 vision to its place these competing
04:21:35.439 ideas are growing in strength and
04:21:37.960 oracles signal the coming of a new age
04:21:41.279 which system comes to rule the new world
04:21:43.600 is unknown but the tarnished who slew
04:21:46.159 The earthree Sentinel had the brute
04:21:48.159 strength to reach the Earth tree whether
04:21:51.080 it would be this tarnished or another it
04:21:53.479 was inevitable the Earth tree would fall
04:21:56.239 other Visions for the future had become
04:21:58.199 clear and the old tree was broken down
04:22:01.720 in the end it took so little to burn the
04:22:06.040 tree burn for the sake of the new
04:22:10.960 Lord it had been changing into kindling
04:22:13.920 for a good long time once the a tree has
04:22:17.359 burnt it leaves only the husk of its
04:22:19.760 trunk The Roots unchanged below the
04:22:22.680 Earth in the Panic of its death the
04:22:24.800 seeds of the old Society are cast far
04:22:27.439 and wide the seed the richest part of
04:22:30.640 the fruit carries its values its culture
04:22:34.640 its system the old ages system of Life
04:22:38.720 the age of Plenty was sealed in those
04:22:40.880 seeds with the potential to live again
04:22:44.040 they grow as illusions of gold far and
04:22:46.680 wide many will have faith in these nent
04:22:49.560 Illusions after all the past is more
04:22:52.080 likely to return than the present
04:22:54.279 realizes much yearns to return to what
04:22:57.000 once was and this young gold is far from
04:23:00.720 kindling but if the present is not left
04:23:03.279 to chaos then a new illusion can form
04:23:06.000 upon the husk of the tree upon the roots
04:23:08.560 of Life a tree of vision each one unique
04:23:13.680 whether a vision of the past once more
04:23:16.040 continuing all as it was a divided time
04:23:19.880 an age of fracture of gold and fading of
04:23:24.680 leaves yet falling or an order where the
04:23:28.279 leaves do not
04:23:30.199 fall or an age of Despair or an age of
04:23:34.000 the duskborn all these Visions can
04:23:36.600 become a new tree for these runes do
04:23:39.239 exist they have been gestated and are
04:23:41.960 possible whatever the consequences for
04:23:44.840 if the death of the earth tree taught
04:23:46.439 anything it is that ideals however
04:23:49.040 Divine may bring death the game of
04:23:52.159 survival is always being played no
04:23:55.040 matter the
04:24:01.880 scale a new age begins but the past does
04:24:05.520 not vanish in the next age it lives on
04:24:08.520 in more than seeds it is all around us
04:24:11.680 in the new age AG it is like ash coats
04:24:14.760 the ground it looms over us it
04:24:18.119 fertilizes the Earth of the new tree it
04:24:21.319 is in ourselves it is in the air we
04:24:24.199 breathe it is in the streets and in our
04:24:26.920 homes no matter how we trying to seal
04:24:29.199 out the past the ash of the past can
04:24:32.600 only be dispersed with time and at the
04:24:35.359 coming of another age some ash will
04:24:37.880 still be there only to be buried yet
04:24:40.680 Deeper by the ash of another society
04:24:43.239 that has
04:24:44.960 fallen but the fallen leaves tell an
04:24:47.439 even deeper story they fall from the
04:24:50.159 earth tree but where else are they
04:24:52.439 falling the whole alter's Plateau is in
04:24:55.399 a deep Autumn where are the leaves green
04:24:59.760 far away from the earth tree the Earth
04:25:03.119 tree is literally drawing the energy of
04:25:05.840 life from leagues around it why is the
04:25:08.840 earth tree drawing so much why is it
04:25:11.319 draining the entire entire land around
04:25:13.600 it we Now understand why the ancestral
04:25:16.920 chant trees far from the perview of the
04:25:19.319 earth tree they are focusing life's
04:25:21.880 energies into a single tree for it is
04:25:25.520 just as we said the vitals of Life Al
04:25:28.439 like energy itself they cannot be
04:25:30.840 created or destroyed only gathered and
04:25:34.359 dispersed look at the trees that
04:25:36.399 flourish in Gold that grow tall what is
04:25:40.040 all around them and on the map on all
04:25:44.159 the smaller trees fallen leaves death it
04:25:48.840 is life from Death the vitals of Life
04:25:52.159 cannot be destroyed but can be moved and
04:25:56.399 the Earth Tre is doing this at an
04:25:58.560 unprecedented scale which leads us to
04:26:01.800 something foreign to this land just like
04:26:04.439 the Earth tree itself when we seek to
04:26:07.239 replace the current order we must fight
04:26:09.119 a God but to kill this God leads to a
04:26:11.920 fight
04:26:12.920 with a beast the fight takes place on
04:26:15.680 another plane here there are golden
04:26:18.800 trees many trees that are half invisible
04:26:22.880 Great golden Illusions but all of them
04:26:26.600 the same these trees are not the color
04:26:29.319 of Despair or of dusk or of any of the
04:26:32.279 many orders that could be they are all
04:26:35.119 the color of the her tree we
04:26:38.880 know do you see look at the tree Tre The
04:26:44.399 Roots The Ordering of them by
04:26:47.600 Rings the original great Tree of
04:26:52.199 Life
04:26:54.880 cut and the Earth tree a
04:26:57.800 topet a tree of Illusion and at the top
04:27:01.640 of this tree buds a
04:27:04.319 port connecting to other
04:27:08.800 worlds the fallen leaves tell a story
04:27:12.359 our land is not the innovator it is not
04:27:15.319 the first to create a tree such as this
04:27:18.359 we have been brought to this stage by
04:27:20.080 The Guiding hand of the Agents of Empire
04:27:23.399 our system is a product brought by a
04:27:26.680 beast on a star sent into the lands
04:27:29.600 between it is a product that has worked
04:27:32.279 before elsewhere a system grafted onto
04:27:35.520 our yet developing world and with the
04:27:38.040 system in place the resources of the
04:27:40.199 lands between can be taed the energy
04:27:43.279 harvested from it this brought abundance
04:27:45.960 but only initially it is part of a
04:27:48.640 larger plan to draw the Life Energy of
04:27:51.720 an Empire the system is grafted onto our
04:27:54.319 land and now the life can be drained
04:27:57.000 like a
04:27:58.399 tap Faith was one amongst those in the
04:28:01.279 lands between with the early success of
04:28:03.520 this system but is this Faith Justified
04:28:07.159 each new realm conquered could be given
04:28:09.359 the illusion of abundance simply by
04:28:11.319 taxing the previous conquered lands
04:28:14.439 perhaps America was right to question
04:28:16.840 her faith such a beast is far beyond
04:28:20.600 comprehension is it just a predator a
04:28:23.840 parasite or is this just the early
04:28:26.720 beastial stage of something greater like
04:28:30.239 the blood spent to water the tree in the
04:28:32.399 old times is the fading of the lands
04:28:35.000 between a temporary sacrifice before a
04:28:37.840 great Empire of trees can take place
04:28:40.640 sharing the energy of life across worlds
04:28:43.479 in a new age of abundance perhaps the
04:28:46.640 future will come in its own way
04:28:48.520 regardless as though Guided by the hand
04:28:51.119 of a greater will or perhaps it is up to
04:28:54.119 the tarnished to decide to decide
04:28:56.960 whether you feel blessed as though born
04:28:59.159 at the foot of the tree or cast out from
04:29:02.600 Grace would you hold faith in a beast
04:29:05.319 that a greater order is coming even as
04:29:07.760 your life waines or would you break the
04:29:10.800 connection or or would you rather feel
04:29:13.479 nothing at all whatever your vision
04:29:16.640 tarnished a choice must be made there is
04:29:19.840 a great competition in visions and they
04:29:22.319 crisscross like disordered
04:29:25.359 Grace whatever your vision perhaps just
04:29:29.279 like the painter it is best to wrap your
04:29:32.040 message in art art whose message will
04:29:35.600 only be unlocked long after the rulers
04:29:38.199 have allowed it into the hands of the
04:29:40.439 tarnished
04:29:46.370 [Applause]
04:29:50.840 the world of Elden ring is quite a sight
04:29:53.560 to behold ranging from snowcapped Peaks
04:29:56.760 to giant underground Caverns it is full
04:29:59.920 of Wildlife and Rich history and while
04:30:02.840 we can learn about this history through
04:30:04.840 people and the written word what if we
04:30:07.479 instead widened our gaze to see what the
04:30:10.199 land itself can tell us
04:30:12.640 what stories can be found within the
04:30:14.159 Frozen mountains how many Mysteries are
04:30:17.040 held by the winding underground rivers
04:30:19.560 or towering trees above welcome to
04:30:22.760 mapping the world of Elden ring delving
04:30:26.040 into everything on this topic would take
04:30:27.960 many hours so instead this video seeks
04:30:30.920 to provide an interesting and helpful
04:30:33.199 Baseline of information to help
04:30:34.880 springboard future discussions if you
04:30:37.800 have observations to add or want us to
04:30:40.040 dive into any specific topics let us
04:30:42.399 know down
04:30:43.640 below let's begin with the overall
04:30:46.319 structure of the lands between what
04:30:48.760 stands out to us in the map structure is
04:30:51.479 how the player is passively designed to
04:30:53.680 progress through the game on the whole
04:30:55.920 one naturally begins in areas whose
04:30:57.880 environments generally highlight more
04:30:59.720 recent history such as limb grave or
04:31:02.119 Leonia and then steadily progress into
04:31:04.960 areas that provide a clearer window into
04:31:07.319 the past like the mountain tops of the
04:31:09.399 Giants or faram maula and and so for the
04:31:12.720 most part this is the order we will be
04:31:14.760 diving into the world starting in Lim
04:31:17.880 grave we have a lush green region that
04:31:20.640 seems relatively normal at first glance
04:31:23.640 there is little evidence of war and it
04:31:25.960 generally features little culture
04:31:28.080 enemies wander in a seeming limbo they
04:31:30.720 prey to a raging
04:31:32.180 [Music]
04:31:35.800 dragon and are generally stuck in a sort
04:31:38.479 of stasis but what does stand out is
04:31:41.640 that Lim gray features a number of huge
04:31:44.000 ruins that leave a strong impression of
04:31:46.159 all for any new player they sit in
04:31:48.760 orientations that seem unnatural and
04:31:51.159 their architecture strongly suggests
04:31:53.119 they originate from somewhere else
04:31:54.800 entirely indeed they are covered in
04:31:57.359 ruined fragments which state they are
04:31:59.880 found near places where ruins have
04:32:01.880 fallen from the sky they are believed to
04:32:04.920 have once been part of a temple in the
04:32:08.640 sky the only city of the sky that is
04:32:11.199 presently known is phula which is now in
04:32:14.279 a perpetually crumbling State Beyond
04:32:16.560 Time In the far East of the map there
04:32:19.119 are a couple of complications that feel
04:32:21.279 important here that the ruin pieces are
04:32:24.000 very far from the current location of
04:32:25.720 the flying City and that while the
04:32:28.279 architecture is highly similar both in
04:32:30.640 style and scale between these ruined
04:32:32.680 pieces and the crumbling City they do
04:32:35.479 differ one of the key details throughout
04:32:37.800 the Dragon City is the presence of
04:32:39.800 beasts not only as chosen and guards but
04:32:42.840 they are also literally embedded into
04:32:45.000 the buildings themselves however
04:32:47.000 according to the isul abast men ashes
04:32:49.319 the ruins of phula are said to be the
04:32:52.119 remains of a giant mosum enshrining an
04:32:54.920 ancient dragon thus it may be the case
04:32:57.640 that not all Dragon City architecture
04:32:59.920 would feature beasts in this crypt-like
04:33:02.199 style there could therefore have been
04:33:04.840 other areas of the city that dropped
04:33:06.719 these ruins or even other flying cities
04:33:10.000 which did not have the same beast in
04:33:11.799 incorporation within the brick work we
04:33:14.160 will look at this idea more closely
04:33:16.160 later limra as a whole provides a
04:33:19.160 fantastic learning ground for a new
04:33:21.039 player as it manages to have the highest
04:33:23.278 density of mini dungeons like caves
04:33:25.759 catacombs or mines while still staying
04:33:28.320 relatively calm and open we think this
04:33:31.278 highlights that while currently the
04:33:33.400 place features little culture at all
04:33:35.359 long ago the region must have thrived as
04:33:37.759 a hive of activity and that at some
04:33:40.160 point this Prosperity was lost given the
04:33:43.400 lack of evidence of War here other than
04:33:45.719 the Rebellion at Castle mour this was
04:33:48.000 likely lost a long time ago could the
04:33:50.680 gigantic pillars we see hint at some
04:33:53.080 previous civilization that existed here
04:33:55.879 perhaps the desolation of culture is
04:33:57.879 from the storm Lord's defeat at the
04:33:59.759 hands of
04:34:01.480 Godfrey or maybe it's a natural result
04:34:04.400 due to being the farthest area from the
04:34:06.160 earth tree during its Reign and
04:34:08.240 receiving the least of its bounty after
04:34:10.520 all the people of the Plateau believe
04:34:12.879 that those born at the foot of the earth
04:34:14.879 tree are blast whatever the case may be
04:34:17.879 Lim grave highlights the lack of recent
04:34:20.320 large scale activity and this is very
04:34:23.080 important when we take into account the
04:34:25.199 fact that we are tarnished who has only
04:34:27.879 recently been returned their Grace and
04:34:30.118 beckoned to the lands between arises
04:34:32.799 here of all places something we will
04:34:35.799 come back to in future
04:34:40.639 videos moving on to Leonia we notice the
04:34:43.680 region has a much more extreme landscape
04:34:47.000 a huge Lake on which R lucaria is
04:34:50.000 managing to remain tall flanked either
04:34:52.520 side by high-rise Cliffs the name Leonia
04:34:56.000 of the Lakes seems to be misleading
04:34:58.759 initially as the area features only one
04:35:01.320 Lake that encompasses the entire Valley
04:35:04.359 but the map helps here the majority of
04:35:07.199 Leonia is sinking into a lake thus
04:35:10.639 perhaps the region used to be made up of
04:35:13.039 many much smaller lakes that have
04:35:15.320 expanded and conjoined into what we see
04:35:17.599 today this would explain how the academy
04:35:19.958 Gate Town was set up beneath R lucaria
04:35:22.561 and how the various ruins found in the
04:35:24.680 lake would have been established that is
04:35:27.080 they were originally on dry land if the
04:35:30.278 name for the region is a misfit it
04:35:32.438 implies that what is causing Leonia to
04:35:34.599 sink down must be a relatively recent
04:35:37.400 event and the landscape of the academy
04:35:39.799 Gate Town can attest to that the angles
04:35:42.480 of its buildings almost seem as Extreme
04:35:45.000 as the ruins we found in Lim grave which
04:35:47.438 it must be noted are also found
04:35:49.480 throughout Leonia given the east side of
04:35:52.561 Leonia features the high road and R
04:35:55.520 lucaria itself said they wouldn't
04:35:57.680 interfere with the shattering we can
04:35:59.480 assume the change to the marsh land is a
04:36:01.799 more natural influence as opposed to
04:36:04.799 some result of armies marching through
04:36:07.000 or Waring in the area though it does
04:36:09.520 seem that the Eastern High Road does not
04:36:11.359 come currently lead all the way to
04:36:12.879 Northern Leonia there is still little
04:36:15.480 evidence of the activity of armies in
04:36:17.599 the lake area so either the ground
04:36:20.759 itself is losing stability or there has
04:36:23.919 been an influx of water the lake of rot
04:36:27.039 does lie below this region but we don't
04:36:29.359 know just how much lower this is and the
04:36:32.118 ancient architecture would suggest that
04:36:34.438 its influence on the stability of the
04:36:36.160 region is by no means a new one the
04:36:38.759 crystals above the lake are interesting
04:36:41.118 though perhaps they provide some sort of
04:36:43.359 protection that keeps R lucaria standing
04:36:45.879 strong and may even be one of the
04:36:47.879 reasons for the Academy's
04:36:50.000 location we don't think the flooding
04:36:52.160 could be caused by weather changes the
04:36:54.199 region was already known for its
04:36:55.719 everpresent fog and if we look to the
04:36:57.958 Weeping Peninsula known for its
04:37:00.039 endlessly rainy climate we find no
04:37:02.480 flooding of note if we look instead for
04:37:05.359 a source of water that could be flooding
04:37:07.278 the Lakes we are led to the ruin strewn
04:37:10.359 precipice which which interestingly
04:37:12.879 features for the second time the archaic
04:37:15.719 architecture that we saw in the pillars
04:37:18.000 in limb grave these structures do in
04:37:21.000 fact seem to be built for the water flow
04:37:23.759 so the Water Source surely isn't a
04:37:26.320 recent development however being so
04:37:29.118 inlaid into the cliff could indicate
04:37:31.599 that it was at some point hidden from
04:37:33.719 the outside and was actually within the
04:37:36.160 cliff Leading The Water Somewhere
04:37:38.320 underground as such it is possible that
04:37:41.000 they were only only Unearthed in recent
04:37:43.240 times indeed if we look to the exit at
04:37:46.039 the top we can see the sight of many
04:37:48.278 destroyed Caravans and a number of omen
04:37:51.160 one of which is even crying evidently a
04:37:53.958 sight of a lot of recent activity
04:37:56.879 furthermore it may have been the case
04:37:59.000 that the grand lift of deus was not in
04:38:01.400 action during the shattering as we find
04:38:03.599 The Medallion halves far away in Lim
04:38:06.320 grave and kalid so the scaffolding up
04:38:10.000 the precipice may have there for only
04:38:12.000 been carved out during that time the
04:38:14.719 pathway does seem very haphazardly
04:38:16.840 crafted as if it was only intended as a
04:38:19.480 temporary solution if so it is possible
04:38:22.680 that this waterfall was only released
04:38:24.639 recently by uncovering the structure and
04:38:27.639 is what is causing Leonia to sink so
04:38:32.958 quickly the alter Plateau home to mount
04:38:36.480 gmir lendelle even the Earth tree itself
04:38:40.278 is the first region the shattering has
04:38:42.561 left clear scars across there are
04:38:45.039 barricades and Soldier camps throughout
04:38:47.400 and various impact wounds in the ground
04:38:50.400 Mount gmer the sight of the most
04:38:53.118 appalling battle in the entirety of the
04:38:55.400 shattering also has countless dead
04:38:57.759 bodies piled up Reichard became the Lord
04:39:01.438 of blasphemy marking the UR tree as the
04:39:03.719 enemy which in turn brought the armies
04:39:05.840 of the capital to his doorstep what is
04:39:08.680 interesting is that despite the numerous
04:39:10.919 campsites of these soldiers and the
04:39:13.000 various Battlegrounds some of which are
04:39:15.240 still populated even now there is no
04:39:18.278 evidence of the fight reaching the Mana
04:39:20.599 which is in pristine condition however
04:39:23.840 the prison Town hidden behind is
04:39:26.320 definitely not on our arrival we can see
04:39:29.359 this town is in bad shape it is unclear
04:39:32.080 if the lava has risen as the
04:39:33.759 architecture seems to fit the height the
04:39:35.561 lava is at but the buildings are
04:39:37.600 nonetheless broken and sinking this
04:39:40.560 discrepancy between the town and the
04:39:42.680 manor indicates the temporal distance
04:39:44.958 between their construction and implies
04:39:47.560 that the town and perhaps it serpent men
04:39:50.400 were around long before Reichard set up
04:39:53.040 here it's fair to assume that prisoners
04:39:55.760 would have been from war but the serpent
04:39:57.878 men are said to have Arisen long ago and
04:40:01.040 the fact that the town seems to be
04:40:02.440 crumbling amidst the lava is certainly
04:40:05.160 interesting has the lava control of the
04:40:07.560 god devouring serpent changed in some
04:40:09.798 way over the years or was the town never
04:40:12.638 fit to last in such a brutal
04:40:15.560 environment outside of the manor at one
04:40:18.280 of the bleer Battlegrounds is a dead or
04:40:21.280 at least broken minor her tree trees are
04:40:25.000 of course a huge part of the law of
04:40:27.080 Elden ring and as such will require a
04:40:29.600 more focused video to dive into but for
04:40:32.240 now there are a couple observations that
04:40:34.400 are worth noting within this video and
04:40:36.680 we'd love to hear what your thoughts are
04:40:38.520 on them and on the game's trees as a
04:40:40.718 whole
04:40:42.480 first is the size variety of the minor
04:40:45.040 her trees throughout the world or rather
04:40:47.958 the lack of variety for all the
04:40:50.840 different locations and their climates
04:40:53.240 for all the history associated with each
04:40:55.638 area and for all their differing
04:40:57.638 distances to the Earth tree they are all
04:41:00.360 of the same scale and the second
04:41:03.200 pertains to the Earth tree at this
04:41:05.080 Battleground that it is broken and
04:41:07.878 seemingly dead and is the first that we
04:41:10.200 have seen in such shape
04:41:12.000 what exactly caused this to happen and
04:41:14.520 when we will come back to this later
04:41:18.120 before we continue let's take a moment
04:41:20.360 to step back and look at the roads of
04:41:22.958 the world landelle is the capital of the
04:41:25.560 age of the Earth tree the most recent
04:41:27.560 superpower across the lands between and
04:41:30.160 looking at the transport links that lead
04:41:32.000 out from it can tell us some of the most
04:41:34.000 common and useful journeys of the age if
04:41:37.280 we follow the main road out of the
04:41:38.920 capital we are LED through the alter's
04:41:40.920 plate
04:41:41.840 and down the grand lift of deus towards
04:41:44.958 Leonia there is also a secondary path
04:41:47.958 that hugs the northern coast reaching
04:41:50.240 the windmill Villages which suggests
04:41:52.798 some
04:41:53.638 importance interestingly despite the
04:41:56.120 east side of Leonia being home to a
04:41:58.638 highway road running North and South
04:42:01.400 When we arrive at the scene this is only
04:42:03.718 really the case for the southern
04:42:07.400 half one would more naturally go via r
04:42:10.680 lucari to head down into limb grave and
04:42:14.000 it is clear that there are few branching
04:42:16.360 paths in Leonia unlike the outers
04:42:18.958 plateau or Lim grave this region seems
04:42:21.600 to be something people passed through
04:42:24.000 rather than traveled within further
04:42:26.280 reinforcing the sense of a closed
04:42:28.240 society that managed to keep what was
04:42:30.718 theirs the caran West Coast seems even
04:42:33.760 more cut off with little to no links to
04:42:36.878 outside it must be noted of course that
04:42:39.440 the newly formed lake is uding roads
04:42:41.958 that may have been more prevalent many
04:42:43.840 years ago on reaching limb grave the
04:42:47.120 main path splits to either head towards
04:42:50.400 kid or the Weeping
04:42:57.920 Peninsula for the path to kalid it is
04:43:00.480 certainly interesting that it seems to
04:43:02.240 reach no further than halfway through
04:43:04.480 the region perhaps not all of kalid was
04:43:07.520 accessible to those of outside regions
04:43:10.080 and as we shall see this this may be due
04:43:12.000 to its ties with
04:43:13.440 phoua now it is difficult to say what
04:43:16.280 such roads were used for the most simply
04:43:19.200 for efficient Army travel or for more
04:43:22.040 complex transfer of goods between
04:43:24.400 regions the roads do seem to have been
04:43:26.840 built with access to the Arenas in mind
04:43:29.600 so perhaps there was even some tourism
04:43:32.680 the only times we see such paths being
04:43:34.718 used are by convoys where we see trolls
04:43:37.560 pulling a caravan along or perhaps being
04:43:40.440 patrolled by the night Cavalry either
04:43:43.440 way the paths or lack thereof certainly
04:43:46.760 illustrate what warranted investment by
04:43:48.840 the higher powers in the age so the
04:43:51.320 challenge going forward will be to work
04:43:53.400 out
04:43:56.718 why now
04:43:59.110 [Music]
04:44:00.400 kalid this region is the anomaly of the
04:44:03.240 formula thus far other than perhaps Lim
04:44:06.200 grave with godric's grafting activity
04:44:08.798 this is actually the site of the most
04:44:10.638 recent to large scale events that of
04:44:13.160 Redan and melania's battle in the
04:44:15.040 shattering the Battle of aonia and when
04:44:18.560 we arrive we are struck by the scene of
04:44:20.560 a region that has been completely
04:44:22.240 engulfed with Scarlet rot praise America
04:44:25.240 that these chest High walls were already
04:44:27.480 established near the border to Lim grave
04:44:29.560 else who knows how much it may have
04:44:31.680 spread the Scarlet rot however instead
04:44:34.480 of Simply erasing the history of the
04:44:36.400 land seems to have given an amazing
04:44:38.840 insight into ancient history to us it
04:44:42.320 seems as though the entire region has
04:44:44.280 been dissolved and many layers of the
04:44:46.600 land have been cleared away the roots of
04:44:49.200 the trees that once stood here that were
04:44:51.280 assumedly underground before are now
04:44:53.638 towering high above us and we are now
04:44:56.718 met with the terrifying view of some
04:44:59.760 huge ancient skeletons
04:45:03.140 [Music]
04:45:12.638 they are so colossal that few of us
04:45:14.600 would even realize what they were if not
04:45:16.560 for seeeing them from a distance they
04:45:19.200 seem humanoid in structure though it's
04:45:21.798 difficult to make out much detail below
04:45:23.440 the chest if we assume they are related
04:45:25.878 to the Giants in some manner The visar
04:45:28.120 Shield having an instructional function
04:45:30.798 further reinforces that their unveiling
04:45:32.798 in kalid is recent either way their
04:45:35.760 depth in the earth is surely a testament
04:45:37.798 to how long ago they must have died just
04:45:40.280 like in the real world where you can cut
04:45:42.120 down into the Earth and see the
04:45:43.638 different ages in the Stacked layers so
04:45:46.120 too might this shine a light on what may
04:45:48.280 have existed prehistorically the only
04:45:50.760 other location we see such skeletons is
04:45:52.798 in the mountaintops of the Giants the
04:45:54.840 most well preserved region from the past
04:45:57.400 which we will look at later there is a
04:45:59.878 theme throughout Elden ring surrounding
04:46:02.000 the size of life and how it has changed
04:46:04.280 over time be them these hidden behemoths
04:46:07.120 that are now no longer seen the Giants
04:46:09.480 becoming trolls or while the dragons
04:46:11.520 being compared to their ancient
04:46:13.280 counterparts there is always a decrease
04:46:16.040 of size this is not just a correlation
04:46:19.400 but something the law actively draws
04:46:21.480 attention to the present day dragons are
04:46:26.040 mocked and the state of the trolls is
04:46:28.600 described with Melancholy even humans
04:46:31.638 are derided by the giant Crusher
04:46:33.878 description man has grown feeble in
04:46:36.400 comparison to his forbears the vulgar
04:46:39.120 militia ashes say that in in the lands
04:46:41.400 between the small was scorned and so
04:46:44.280 they formed their vulgar militia as a
04:46:46.000 means to make a living given the tale
04:46:48.320 the land is weaving in front of us this
04:46:50.440 makes a lot of sense if we move to the
04:46:53.200 cliff side and redan's Beach arena we
04:46:55.798 see for the third time this archaic
04:46:58.638 giant arched pillar architecture its
04:47:01.558 Stone finish seems just as intact as in
04:47:04.160 previous locations which shows a
04:47:06.400 resilience to Scarlet rot that may help
04:47:08.520 to date it to add to the mix we have the
04:47:11.638 golum enemies and the Divine Towers
04:47:14.160 which both seem to feature very similar
04:47:16.200 designs as well as the same slightly
04:47:18.600 soften stone that feels as though it has
04:47:21.120 stood the test of time and natural
04:47:23.480 erosion however going into such law will
04:47:26.200 have to wait for another episode so stay
04:47:28.360 tuned for
04:47:29.760 that in the center of kalid is the swamp
04:47:32.840 of aonia a very important location that
04:47:35.520 will require its own Deep dive for now
04:47:38.240 though note that it appears to be a rot
04:47:40.558 w water source that continually bubbles
04:47:43.320 up something that we will come back to
04:47:45.480 in a bit in the Far East of kalid we
04:47:48.240 have the beastial sanctum which also
04:47:50.200 links to faram aula not only is accessed
04:47:53.200 by the farum great bridge but it too has
04:47:55.878 highly similar architecture and unlike
04:47:58.480 the ruins in limra orania beasts are
04:48:01.280 featured within the stone itself what is
04:48:04.040 worth noting about the bridge and the
04:48:06.080 structure below the Beast steal sanctum
04:48:08.120 is that these are built specifically for
04:48:11.240 these locations they fit the coastline
04:48:14.160 geography so was farum always a flying
04:48:17.280 City or was it grounded at some point or
04:48:21.000 is farum in fact the name of the culture
04:48:24.000 and thus every location might simply
04:48:26.280 have the farum prefix after all there is
04:48:29.600 another great bridge in the crumbling
04:48:31.680 City if this was the naming culture it
04:48:34.920 may mean there were multiple such FM
04:48:36.958 cities that in descriptions get grouped
04:48:39.320 in a similar way to the eternal cities
04:48:42.040 thus would the civilization have exerted
04:48:44.040 a wide control over both land and sky
04:48:47.160 and perhaps is how they reached Lim
04:48:49.280 grave and Leonia either way it is a
04:48:52.360 fearsome power to be sure moving to the
04:48:55.480 capital there are a few geographical
04:48:57.638 details that jump out in particular are
04:49:00.440 the Earth tree which we'll have to wait
04:49:02.440 for another time the moat and the
04:49:04.920 capital's location which say a lot about
04:49:07.200 the UR tre's history without needing to
04:49:09.080 read the various descriptions in the
04:49:10.840 game landal is in a highly defensive
04:49:13.878 position enemies can only really come
04:49:16.600 from one side given all the other sides
04:49:18.958 are protected by high mountains or giant
04:49:21.440 Cliffs down to the water it has high
04:49:23.958 ground and Can See For Miles around and
04:49:26.400 features a large moat in addition to two
04:49:29.280 outer walls coupled with its source of
04:49:31.760 water lendelle can withstand a Siege
04:49:34.040 with ease this design and location of
04:49:36.798 landal and of course the UR Trey is one
04:49:39.638 of defensive tactics and indicates the
04:49:42.878 expectation of retaliation against them
04:49:45.760 which is exactly what happened in the
04:49:48.120 beginning everything was in opposition
04:49:50.280 to the ER tree but through countless
04:49:52.558 victories in war it became the
04:49:54.400 embodiment of order even their Army's
04:49:57.280 fighting style mirrors this the soldiers
04:49:59.638 of leandel fight their battles
04:50:03.798 defensively the mountaintops is where
04:50:06.240 America and Godfrey fought the Giants
04:50:08.480 and subsequently made the lands
04:50:10.000 forbidden as such when the tarnished
04:50:12.480 arrives the region is in an almost
04:50:14.878 unchanged State and provides a great
04:50:17.320 window to the past there are two details
04:50:20.400 that seem contradictory at first we use
04:50:23.320 the grand lift of roll to reach the
04:50:25.480 mountaintops a mark of high levels of
04:50:28.080 investment in order to make the journey
04:50:29.760 more pragmatic but we must then cross a
04:50:32.878 very dangerous and seemingly improvised
04:50:35.760 bridge to reach the main land mass now
04:50:39.160 perhaps the lift was only made to help
04:50:41.558 America's large armies and they were
04:50:44.000 then under attack when building the
04:50:45.718 bridge and thus couldn't manage anything
04:50:47.718 more substantial but it may instead
04:50:50.480 indicate a time in history that is
04:50:52.440 hidden from our view a time where those
04:50:55.280 of the capital and those of the
04:50:57.080 mountaintops were not officially enemies
04:51:00.480 a Time perhaps where America would have
04:51:02.718 been able to safely reach the trolls and
04:51:04.920 persuade them to side with her indeed
04:51:07.878 this region again features some of the
04:51:09.878 enormous skeletons so like kalid could
04:51:13.200 this imply some damage to the Earth to
04:51:15.600 uproot these long buried ancient beings
04:51:18.798 perhaps the war against the Giants was
04:51:20.638 so brutal that the region itself
04:51:22.680 suffered a large degree of damage and
04:51:24.878 the landscape was broken and Stripped
04:51:26.920 Away this would explain why there is no
04:51:29.320 longer a wellestablished path to lead to
04:51:31.480 the mountaintops and thus perhaps the
04:51:33.878 grand lift instead hints to the time
04:51:36.360 before the war after all we know that
04:51:39.638 the astrologers and Giants lived
04:51:41.638 peacefully as Neighbors at some point
04:51:44.638 most of what we see in the region is the
04:51:46.440 wake of War rampants forts graveyards
04:51:50.480 and dead Giants on first glance these
04:51:53.440 Giants seem Afflicted with death blight
04:51:56.160 but in fact this appears to be weapons
04:51:58.400 that utilize briers of sin just like
04:52:00.558 those outside the guardian's Garrison
04:52:03.080 but if we look to the land itself it may
04:52:06.040 speak of the time that came before the
04:52:07.840 war such as with the Frozen River and
04:52:10.718 Lake we can see there must be a water
04:52:13.040 source in the Eastern side of the map
04:52:15.040 that forms the lake the river then runs
04:52:17.718 westwards falling down into the
04:52:19.600 consecrated snow fields until it makes
04:52:21.680 its way to the ocean running water can
04:52:24.520 freeze even a waterfall can freeze over
04:52:27.360 long periods of time one should still
04:52:29.638 see slight movement so a waterfall would
04:52:32.878 still be present whether Frozen or
04:52:36.760 not given the power of the Giant's God
04:52:39.600 was Fire based and is represented as a
04:52:42.120 sun it is likely that the time of the
04:52:44.200 fire Giants featured a much warmer
04:52:46.440 climate and that the lake and river was
04:52:48.840 not originally Frozen the name freezing
04:52:52.000 Lake could be a use of the present
04:52:54.200 continuous it is still freezing and thus
04:52:57.280 implies it only began the process
04:52:59.040 relatively recently though this is not
04:53:01.400 necessarily what the name means the name
04:53:04.480 Castle Soul which likely functioned as a
04:53:07.040 fort for America's army during the war
04:53:09.400 implies it was worn even then or at
04:53:12.040 least that the region featured a more
04:53:13.878 prominent sun and thus the new climate
04:53:16.600 is most likely a consequence of the
04:53:18.878 defeat of the Giants now if this region
04:53:22.120 was at some point warmer it must have
04:53:24.240 been a more plentiful location than we
04:53:26.360 at first have thought and there are the
04:53:28.638 odd hints of this Rin Roa are thought to
04:53:32.000 be the original strain of Roa and are
04:53:34.360 the most powerful of the r subspecies
04:53:36.638 for healing torrent the Giants were
04:53:39.240 established enough to be able ble to
04:53:40.680 make technological advancements as
04:53:43.160 perhaps with the forge the art of
04:53:45.320 smithing is said to have originated
04:53:47.480 among the Giants this is also the fourth
04:53:50.520 location where we see the huge arched
04:53:53.040 Stone architecture and there are more
04:53:55.558 here than anywhere else that may suggest
04:53:58.120 a more builtup area though it could just
04:54:00.840 be that elsewhere has suffered more
04:54:02.680 damage in the time since and as if to
04:54:05.638 draw comparison to the plentiful times
04:54:07.638 of old it is here that the only other
04:54:10.400 broken minor herries are found this time
04:54:13.240 in a region that has seen little
04:54:15.080 activity since the war with the Giants
04:54:17.638 which certainly suggests the extremity
04:54:19.718 of the mountaintops especially when
04:54:22.040 compared to even kalid where the minor
04:54:24.440 her trees Stand Tall we will definitely
04:54:27.280 be focusing on the minor Earth trees as
04:54:29.680 well as the halic tree and the Earth
04:54:31.280 tree itself at some point in the future
04:54:34.120 they deserve their own Deep dive if we
04:54:37.080 follow the Earth tree to its roots
04:54:39.040 however we find the nameless Eternal
04:54:41.718 City one of three known Eternal cities
04:54:44.718 all of which are deep
04:54:47.000 underground this area the deep root
04:54:49.718 depths features the source of both the
04:54:52.320 anel and copur rivers around which the
04:54:55.400 other two Eternal cities are based there
04:54:58.400 are certainly many questions regarding
04:55:00.680 the Eternal cities questions surrounding
04:55:03.360 nox Stellar's Moon their actions towards
04:55:06.000 the greater will their subsequent
04:55:08.080 banishment and destruction and and even
04:55:10.680 their potential involvement with the
04:55:12.240 black knives to name a few so let's see
04:55:15.558 if the world itself can shed some light
04:55:18.600 first of all is the state each city is
04:55:21.240 in Noella and nocon are certainly in a
04:55:24.360 sort of limbo and there is rubble and
04:55:26.760 dead ends throughout but for the most
04:55:28.718 part they are in surprisingly decent
04:55:31.240 condition especially considering the
04:55:33.280 state of other places we have seen all
04:55:35.760 the ruins in the Overworld the academy
04:55:37.920 gate town faram maula and number of
04:55:40.638 other places show much worse signs of
04:55:42.680 where than these Eternal cities this is
04:55:45.400 strange given Asel leveled the Eternal
04:55:48.280 City after the KNX invoked the ey of the
04:55:51.798 greater will however here as well as in
04:55:55.600 almost all items that make reference to
04:55:57.840 the Eternal City they reference them as
04:56:00.638 just that the Eternal City which is
04:56:04.360 strange given we know there are at least
04:56:06.878 three separate Eternal cities
04:56:09.680 furthermore the only Eternal City we see
04:56:12.480 that has any level of Destruction that
04:56:14.360 would warrant such a description is the
04:56:16.480 nameless Eternal City its buildings are
04:56:19.600 sparse and
04:56:21.600 broken nameless is certainly telling
04:56:24.798 that it is not forgotten or ancient like
04:56:28.040 the O ruins it is
04:56:30.638 nameless this is deliberate a wiping of
04:56:34.638 Records like the firstborn son in Dark
04:56:37.360 Souls 1 later called the nameless King
04:56:40.400 King this is also the only Eternal City
04:56:43.320 that lacks its Starry Sky which we can
04:56:45.760 see is present in both the other Eternal
04:56:48.040 cities as well as in ael's Arena after
04:56:51.798 all AEL destroyed an eternal City and
04:56:55.120 took away their Sky if we do assume that
04:56:59.160 only one Eternal City was destroyed by
04:57:01.400 Asel what exactly happened with the
04:57:03.520 other two we know the Lost Black Moon of
04:57:06.400 Noella was the guide of countless Stars
04:57:09.240 additionally the were banished deep
04:57:11.680 underground by the greater will these
04:57:14.200 would certainly suggest that they were
04:57:16.000 banished from the surface to the
04:57:17.878 underground which seped their ties to
04:57:20.200 the moon and stars and as such they live
04:57:23.040 under a false night sky but when we
04:57:26.160 visit nocon or Noella in addition to the
04:57:29.360 surprising condition of what remains it
04:57:31.680 is clear that the cities are in fact
04:57:34.160 suited for these underground river
04:57:36.558 regions they have channels that control
04:57:39.120 the water flow
04:57:41.440 including an
04:57:45.080 aqueduct and the building seem to fit
04:57:47.600 the shape of the Earth around them which
04:57:49.958 begs the question how is a full City
04:57:53.120 even banished especially to locations
04:57:55.920 which are otherwise impossible to reach
04:57:58.360 save for a highly secret path through
04:58:00.600 the capital certainly an interesting
04:58:02.878 topic for the future but we'd love to
04:58:04.878 hear your theories down below the
04:58:07.480 nameless Eternal City though destroyed
04:58:09.878 is still surrounded by water features we
04:58:12.718 have a large waterfall that floods the
04:58:14.798 city itself followed by a huge curved
04:58:17.760 waterfall that produces the anel river
04:58:20.440 and on the other side is another large
04:58:22.440 waterfall that makes the copur river
04:58:25.320 however if we track the anel's water
04:58:27.480 movement to its source it seems to
04:58:29.600 originate from this very shallow and
04:58:32.280 calm pool above the city even if there
04:58:35.240 is some Gap the water is coming up
04:58:37.280 through the rate of flow is certainly
04:58:39.680 Str
04:58:40.840 it's almost as if the water is expanding
04:58:42.798 as it
04:58:43.798 travels and we see the same with the
04:58:46.080 seop
04:58:48.080 source to add to the oddies is the white
04:58:51.040 cloudiness of the water here this can be
04:58:53.280 seen while at an angle indicating the
04:58:55.440 white particles are suspended in the
04:58:57.280 water not that the ground beneath is
04:58:59.600 white water is in many places in the
04:59:02.120 game but we only ever see three types of
04:59:04.718 coloration poisoned water Scarlet rot
04:59:07.920 water and this white water water and
04:59:11.200 whatever the cause is of the white color
04:59:13.760 by the time the anel and cofra are
04:59:15.840 established it is
04:59:18.040 gone finally let's talk about the size
04:59:21.160 of the world of Elden ring big as it is
04:59:24.360 and it is definitely huge it is still
04:59:27.120 far smaller than we should consider it
04:59:29.558 within the law this has been the case
04:59:31.680 for all the souls games but especially
04:59:34.200 so in Elden ring if we are to believe
04:59:36.760 that for example zamore had a full
04:59:39.638 history and culture that they could have
04:59:42.240 refined and honed a fighting style of
04:59:44.718 such finesse we are going to have to
04:59:46.798 assume that their ruins are many orders
04:59:49.040 of magnitude bigger than what we find
04:59:52.120 and this goes for every settlement every
04:59:54.920 region and the whole world otherwise
04:59:58.638 scenes such as this Siege in the story
05:00:00.958 trailer simply couldn't make sense the
05:00:03.680 world needs to be large enough to
05:00:05.558 support such a population to allow for
05:00:08.040 the development of so many indiv
05:00:09.958 dependent cultures and so on and we
05:00:12.680 think this is important to remember
05:00:14.480 going forwards as we go deeper and
05:00:17.200 deeper into the
05:00:19.220 [Music]
05:00:27.400 law like many people we wanted to know
05:00:30.320 what on Earth the women in dominula are
05:00:32.878 doing after 18 months we think we've
05:00:35.840 solved it and the DLC image gave us our
05:00:38.760 click moment spoiler alert they do not
05:00:41.718 eat their men in fact it isn't food that
05:00:44.520 they're hungry for at
05:00:48.000 all when we ride up to the Village
05:00:50.600 things seem
05:00:52.040 idilic the sound of laughter picturesque
05:00:55.400 windmills Sparks from a bonfire float in
05:00:58.280 the air and there are even women dancing
05:01:01.280 but as we get closer things very quickly
05:01:04.400 get creepy the windmills are ragged and
05:01:08.120 torn and if we could smell as we play
05:01:11.360 the bonfires wouldn't smell like wood
05:01:13.480 smoke the laughter isn't happy it's just
05:01:20.320 wrong the blue hooded virgins are the
05:01:22.798 focus of the festival but they look more
05:01:25.200 gruesome than an eternal City giant
05:01:27.798 corpse and then once we enter the
05:01:30.600 Village proper their rabid dogs attack
05:01:33.480 us so we realize painfully that this
05:01:37.480 Festival is a bloody one these women
05:01:40.360 wear many colors dance madly have rabid
05:01:44.040 canines ready to defend them worship a
05:01:46.840 serial killer and don't seem to care
05:01:49.080 about any other men disturb their trance
05:01:52.240 and their eyes light up in a bloody rage
05:01:54.920 they will stop the fun and Kill The
05:01:57.000 Uninvited Guest but being killed in
05:01:59.280 Elden ring is to be expected these women
05:02:02.240 get much creepier the weapons they wield
05:02:05.600 are made from human bones they lick
05:02:08.400 these weapons after they have cut their
05:02:10.200 enemies down and the festival bonfires
05:02:12.878 are piled high with the bodies of their
05:02:15.600 men a ghost tells us their fate killed
05:02:20.280 skinned and thrown on the fire dominula
05:02:24.440 means little mistress and these women
05:02:26.760 are definitely the boss looking at the
05:02:29.240 evidence it's tempting to call them
05:02:31.440 maneaters but they are not maneaters in
05:02:34.360 the literal sense so what made these
05:02:37.400 ladies go bad these women once brought
05:02:40.120 in the Harvest their repurposed weapons
05:02:42.958 sickles are for wheat not human flesh
05:02:46.440 they are called celebrants but what are
05:02:48.558 they celebrating their clothes are Blood
05:02:50.958 Stained but we can still see a
05:02:52.520 difference between their outfits some of
05:02:54.920 them have blue hoods these hoods tell us
05:02:57.440 that the wearers are unmarried or
05:02:59.798 virgins who take center stage in the
05:03:02.200 festival so is it a celebration
05:03:04.760 revolving around losing your virginity
05:03:07.680 this makes the puzzle even harder to
05:03:09.440 solve
05:03:10.440 if this is the case why are there no men
05:03:12.480 to be found apart from on the bonfire
05:03:14.920 and why skin them and why worship an
05:03:18.080 apostle what if we told you that all
05:03:20.558 these things make perfect sense there is
05:03:23.280 a method to their Madness from the DLC
05:03:26.360 teaser it looks like we might travel to
05:03:28.680 another time when the windmills were not
05:03:31.000 tattered and the grain grew like a sea
05:03:33.400 of gold once there was abundance and The
05:03:36.600 Villages would Mill the grain for the
05:03:38.360 people in the lands between
05:03:40.280 but now the Grain in the storehouses is
05:03:43.120 rotten the corpses of dead animals
05:03:45.440 litter the ground nearby and rats feed
05:03:47.958 on what's left where once was healthy
05:03:50.480 crops the ground is Barren given over to
05:03:53.558 wild
05:03:55.200 flowers so what changed look up at the
05:03:59.400 windmills how do windmills work in order
05:04:02.558 to Mill the grain which gives life a
05:04:05.600 little of the wind must die but life and
05:04:09.360 death it's itself has been tampered with
05:04:11.600 by America all that Cycles nature
05:04:14.520 through life and death has been
05:04:16.878 sealed now the Farmland the windmills
05:04:20.680 the women all of them have faded life
05:04:23.878 must go on somehow without the
05:04:26.000 nourishment of its Cycles it is
05:04:31.000 unnatural I feel thin sort of stretched
05:04:36.638 like butter scraped over too much bread
05:04:42.160 so the women have had enough and are
05:04:44.638 turning back to the old ways this is why
05:04:47.480 they lick the blood off their blades
05:04:49.798 blood is in birth and death it is a
05:04:52.320 cycle of Life blood is
05:04:56.160 power their weapons Grant Trace Amounts
05:04:59.000 of runes upon Landing attacks just as
05:05:01.718 they take life and they wear many colors
05:05:05.680 turning away from the ruling one true
05:05:08.320 God to the many pagan gods of the past
05:05:11.600 and so they worship the Apostle the
05:05:14.040 Apostle of the glow Queen the deliverer
05:05:17.120 of death which in turn gives the
05:05:19.200 nourishment for new life it's Vitality
05:05:22.558 that they crave for without true death
05:05:25.240 it has been robbed from them look at the
05:05:27.400 women's faces they may be virgins but
05:05:30.160 they are no longer the young Maids they
05:05:32.520 once were kite tals notied that the
05:05:35.040 nearby robe of the Dead Noble is a much
05:05:37.400 brighter blue than the stunning blue of
05:05:40.160 the maiden's hood how faded their hoods
05:05:43.320 are they must have been craving that
05:05:45.200 this Festival reach its climax for many
05:05:48.240 many years and now we can understand the
05:05:52.120 women of
05:05:53.360 dominula because when Marica sealed
05:05:56.000 death all the parts of the cycles of
05:05:58.440 death were affected look at the flowers
05:06:00.680 they decorate the crucifix with life
05:06:03.718 from Death the crucifix has been turned
05:06:06.878 into a mapole
05:06:10.798 and on that bed there was a girl and on
05:06:13.120 that girl there was a man and from that
05:06:15.240 man there was a seed and from that seed
05:06:17.480 there was a boy and from that Bo there
05:06:19.600 was a man and for that there was a grave
05:06:22.600 from that grave
05:06:24.958 there a
05:06:31.638 Tre here too A Life Death cycle created
05:06:35.798 by a man and woman and so the mapole is
05:06:40.360 I know I
05:06:41.638 know right anybody symbol the phic
05:06:47.080 symbol the dominula women are trying to
05:06:49.878 add life to their new phallic symbol
05:06:53.000 which leads us to the skinning and
05:06:54.878 burning of their men these virgins are
05:06:57.520 old because the men just like the worn
05:06:59.958 windmills have no power it has been
05:07:03.040 sealed as the original turtleneck meat
05:07:05.798 item says Turtle meat is said to boost
05:07:08.798 virility but none in the lands between
05:07:11.280 seem to have much appetite for it these
05:07:13.360 days in the lands between the urge to
05:07:16.240 reproduce has wained long ago these
05:07:19.280 women desperately want to lose their
05:07:21.200 virginity but the men are not interested
05:07:24.200 and so the women are like cats on a Hot
05:07:27.000 Tin
05:07:31.040 Roof I was conscious of it
05:07:35.760 [Music]
05:07:41.200 and so the women skin their men because
05:07:44.160 the snake skins itself to be born a new
05:07:47.638 a snake leaves its old faded self behind
05:07:50.680 to emerge bright and vital once more
05:07:53.638 this is the apostles system of renewal
05:07:56.360 the women in their desperation have
05:07:58.400 turned to this snake method but they
05:08:00.840 didn't stop there they turned to fire
05:08:03.480 too in Elden ring fire melts down and
05:08:06.878 reforges a new they are trying to
05:08:09.718 reforge their men as bright and strong
05:08:12.680 once more and what do we see if we leave
05:08:16.120 the ghost a shadow of a man cowering and
05:08:19.120 Afraid To Ride by the human bonfire we
05:08:22.440 see the corpses of men of flame and they
05:08:25.440 stand up imperfectly reborn maybe this
05:08:29.798 Festival will reach its climax after all
05:08:41.040 [Music]
05:08:42.440 for nearly 20 years patches did the same
05:08:45.600 thing he tempted us with treasure and
05:08:48.000 trapped us he had a few methods but his
05:08:51.120 favorite was holes and kicking people
05:08:54.160 down
05:08:58.040 them but in Elden ring something isn't
05:09:02.040 right patches is different eventually we
05:09:06.280 find him in the volcano mana and he
05:09:08.680 seems to to believe in something he is
05:09:13.160 helping this isn't the patches we know
05:09:16.200 solitary and cynical whether he is
05:09:18.878 untethered unbreakable or untrustworthy
05:09:22.440 he always seems to be the same old
05:09:24.360 trickster patches the hyena the cackling
05:09:27.840 scavenger the body kicking corpse looter
05:09:31.638 what's going on here why would he turn
05:09:33.920 up at a place that he warned us about
05:09:37.280 and my warning was spot on you tell me
05:09:39.920 different stay clear of volcano Mana end
05:09:42.840 of discussion I heard the brutes there
05:09:45.160 hunt tarnished like
05:09:47.760 animals and yet here he squats the
05:09:51.080 volcano Mana a place for the strong to
05:09:53.878 rise by strength and become Heroes even
05:09:57.280 if it's by killing their own kind
05:10:00.320 Patch's killing methods aren't based on
05:10:02.600 the
05:10:06.360 jewel some might say just by looking at
05:10:09.040 him that he doesn't fit in here his
05:10:11.520 philosophy of sneaky survival is not to
05:10:14.160 the manner's approach of Might is right
05:10:17.280 so you killed Reichard I Harbor you no
05:10:21.480 ill will the strong take such is our
05:10:27.200 code at first we don't notice what made
05:10:30.520 him change he's giving us regular
05:10:33.360 patches chests traps overacting oh my
05:10:38.680 well here you are again oh so sorry for
05:10:41.320 that I I meant to warn you but whoops
05:10:44.200 there you went but it was the hint about
05:10:46.440 helping Rya that put us on edge by the
05:10:50.200 way uh have you met that girl Rya she's
05:10:52.760 a strange one but I believe she was in
05:10:55.040 need of help not that it's any of my
05:10:57.798 business but if she Rings your bell why
05:11:00.840 not lend her an ear patches hinting that
05:11:03.958 we help a maiden the man who idly sits
05:11:06.958 by as Ry of thorland one of the most
05:11:09.798 charming and gentle characters in all of
05:11:12.400 the from software games starves and
05:11:15.000 Hollows in a hole right beside him he
05:11:17.878 didn't help rehea because well he kicked
05:11:21.080 her down the hole so why the sudden
05:11:23.440 change of heart in patches Patch's
05:11:26.440 history well before Elden ring might
05:11:29.000 tell us why the first clue is who Rhea
05:11:32.958 was a member of the clergy patches
05:11:36.240 connoisseurs or soulsborne fans is there
05:11:39.000 some sometimes called No patches and
05:11:41.680 religion have history Patch's
05:11:45.120 relationship with organized religion its
05:11:47.520 clergy and clerics is complicated it is
05:11:51.520 also murky we may not ever find out his
05:11:54.680 exact reasons but patches hates clerics
05:11:58.000 and as he claims the fraudulence of
05:12:00.400 organized religion he says to them you
05:12:03.360 damn clerics you're worse than maggots
05:12:06.600 this hate seems to continue across every
05:12:09.360 game with the one exception being
05:12:11.680 bloodborne what a joy it is to behold
05:12:14.320 the Divine it must be such a pleasure
05:12:17.638 but this isn't really an exception Pat's
05:12:20.718 obsession with the clergy is that they
05:12:22.680 are frauds don't you be fooled by his
05:12:25.480 claims to do good they're all the same
05:12:27.958 those rotten clerics take your higher
05:12:31.000 cause and stuff it you lousy charlatan
05:12:35.080 yet the power and reality of the Godlike
05:12:37.840 beings in bloodborne is very real so
05:12:41.040 Patch's respecting them isn't contrary
05:12:43.558 to his character there's no fraudulence
05:12:46.400 here so it seems that it's the fakery
05:12:49.480 that upsets patches the taking advantage
05:12:52.440 of the hopes of the weak with in his
05:12:54.760 view the empty promises of
05:12:57.558 superstition well I have news for them
05:13:01.120 praying has not put food in my mouth nor
05:13:04.360 anyone
05:13:06.000 else's of course we shouldn't assume
05:13:08.320 patches is all good he likes to put the
05:13:10.718 fear of God in others too when it suits
05:13:13.320 him you scheming little thief the gods
05:13:17.920 demand
05:13:19.400 repentance the gods demand Vengeance
05:13:23.718 Vengeance not to mention that the hate
05:13:26.200 he feels for the clergy is mutual the
05:13:29.320 acolyte of God has some things to say
05:13:31.638 about him he's a depraved vile man and
05:13:35.160 he deserves no
05:13:37.280 allies and the much loved Rea comes the
05:13:40.240 closest to bad language that she can
05:13:42.440 when describing him Vince and Nico were
05:13:45.360 fooled by a l Nam patches and turned
05:13:48.200 into Hollows and even those with more in
05:13:51.480 common with patches cynical solitary
05:13:54.320 characters such as Grave Rober blig or L
05:13:57.160 Tre don't have good things to say about
05:13:59.760 him have you heard of trusty patches if
05:14:03.680 ever a man has rubbed me up the wrong
05:14:07.280 way if he ever comes around again I
05:14:11.480 swear I'll have his hide there's
05:14:14.878 somebody I ought to warn you about a
05:14:17.160 fellow who lacks common decency they
05:14:20.360 call him patches the hyena and he's the
05:14:23.480 one that laid that trap for me he's the
05:14:25.638 kind of person who'd stab his mother in
05:14:27.440 the back unsurprisingly patches claims
05:14:31.200 the opposite every age it seems is
05:14:35.000 Tainted by the greed of men rubbish to
05:14:38.558 one side such as I devoid of all worldly
05:14:43.390 [Laughter]
05:14:49.520 wants nothing here is stolen I swear I
05:14:54.400 no longer partake in the whole corpse
05:14:57.480 robbing thing yeah no I'm completely
05:15:00.120 free from my vice my old mother would be
05:15:03.280 proud
05:15:04.840 indeed though the phrasing would implies
05:15:08.240 his mother May no longer be with him hm
05:15:12.520 did patches live a life of hardship did
05:15:15.320 he lose his mother to the clergy did he
05:15:18.160 grow up as part of a church and suffer
05:15:20.840 at the hands of clerics or was he always
05:15:24.000 how his detractors describe the worst
05:15:26.718 kind of Vagabond this hate for the
05:15:29.480 clergy affects gameplay in Dark Souls if
05:15:32.798 we tell him we are a cleric there is no
05:15:35.200 chance for forgiveness he attacks if we
05:15:37.718 climb out of the Trap hle
05:15:39.558 his quest ends this history put into the
05:15:43.280 context of Elden ring seems to set
05:15:45.520 things right the volcano Mana is
05:15:48.000 Blasphemous it is Against The Gods the
05:15:50.760 golden order and the two fingers patches
05:15:53.760 himself goes on to say I always hated
05:15:56.638 the gibberish about lost Grace and the
05:15:58.878 laughable two fingers I thought I could
05:16:01.520 lend a hand in unmasking the sherad but
05:16:04.600 we think this is a lie patches has
05:16:07.638 always hated religions of every game but
05:16:11.040 he has never been motivated to do
05:16:12.920 anything more than kick clergy down
05:16:15.200 holes and loot their corpses why would
05:16:17.920 Elden ring make him behave any different
05:16:21.040 in the past there has only been one
05:16:23.320 motivation that worked on patches to get
05:16:26.240 him to act to get him to risk anything
05:16:30.440 caring about someone the one time
05:16:33.320 patches did more than scavenge was to
05:16:35.718 save the life of a friend or something
05:16:39.480 close to it gry rat freed Patches from
05:16:42.718 imprisonment in the past and patches
05:16:45.240 wanted to return the favor he pretends
05:16:47.680 that he's asking where gry rat is simply
05:16:49.920 so he can strip him down for Treasure if
05:16:52.120 he's croaked but this is a lie when gry
05:16:55.680 rat needs it patches saves his life but
05:16:59.320 he decides to hide that he cares I might
05:17:02.718 have died if it wasn't for that peculiar
05:17:05.360 onion night patches tricks gry rat into
05:17:08.440 thinking it was an onion Knight who
05:17:10.400 saved him and takes no credit why for
05:17:14.400 now we will say patches is very
05:17:17.040 secretive about his emotions and so
05:17:20.520 Patch's story of why he is at the
05:17:22.520 volcano Mana begins to unravel he isn't
05:17:26.080 there to fight against the two fingers
05:17:28.280 or the theory of lost Grace he is there
05:17:31.480 because of how he feels for someone
05:17:35.040 because we think for the first time in
05:17:37.920 any game and after nearly 20 years
05:17:41.798 patches is in love he might be free of
05:17:45.680 all worldly wants but perhaps his
05:17:48.160 feeling of Love isn't a worldly want
05:17:52.280 after all patches isn't shallow he
05:17:54.798 doesn't fool for just anyone the
05:17:57.160 debatable first patches had dealings
05:17:59.558 with a character who many men would fool
05:18:02.200 for but not Patches he robs her and
05:18:06.000 bailes but he met someone who fits is
05:18:09.000 Bill in Elden ring a dancer as flexible
05:18:12.840 as he is a blasphemer a woman fighting
05:18:16.638 against the organized religion of the
05:18:19.200 land can you say
05:18:21.760 soulmate patches doesn't even see her
05:18:24.480 face but to him she's
05:18:27.280 beautiful he plays it pretty cool he has
05:18:30.600 plenty of practice at pretending he
05:18:32.600 doesn't care at hiding his emotions
05:18:35.360 under layers of cynicism all he says at
05:18:38.280 first is tanith has always made me
05:18:41.718 curious I guess her master must really
05:18:44.040 be something cuz she's pretty damn smug
05:18:46.760 about it even after announcing her
05:18:49.200 Blasphemous Ambitions she still stands
05:18:51.878 proud I've never seen a woman quite like
05:18:54.840 her this already seems affectionate for
05:18:58.040 patches but eventually he reveals the
05:19:00.798 depths of his true feelings if we pay
05:19:03.440 attention and follow his quest through
05:19:05.600 to the end more than being drawn to the
05:19:08.160 volcano manner by tanith He Is deeply
05:19:10.840 concerned about her when we waver in our
05:19:13.798 commitment he says do you remember your
05:19:16.680 vow to tanith he doesn't remind us about
05:19:19.360 our struggle against our oppressors or
05:19:21.878 the lies of the two fingers only tanith
05:19:25.480 when we succeed in a kill he uses any
05:19:28.160 excuse to see her He suggests I'll give
05:19:31.718 tanith the news have some rest by all
05:19:34.840 means perhaps he only wants the reward
05:19:37.958 or perhaps it says a little more and
05:19:41.120 after we slay Reichard tanith Grieves
05:19:43.958 the death of her Lord patches notices
05:19:47.120 her suffering immediately the demigod
05:19:49.958 Beast is slain and tanith has lost her
05:19:53.280 head this isn't the most tactful comment
05:19:56.878 but this is once again him wearing onion
05:20:00.120 armor patches cares because what does he
05:20:03.798 do next he goes on a quest patches risks
05:20:08.360 his life to retrieve her dancers
05:20:10.920 castanets all just to cheer her up he
05:20:14.400 gets severely injured it seems he
05:20:17.160 literally risked his life this isn't at
05:20:20.360 all like patches someone who survived to
05:20:23.320 the end of the world in Dark Souls I
05:20:25.878 simply by not caring he even admits he's
05:20:29.240 only in this Mass because he followed a
05:20:31.638 different path a unique path he found in
05:20:34.680 Elden ring the path of love
05:20:39.000 this unfamiliar path got him in trouble
05:20:41.878 but he was willing to take it because
05:20:45.280 that's the real treasure it's a treasure
05:20:48.718 valuable enough to risk his life for and
05:20:52.120 he ends up how we find
05:20:55.878 him oh you you
05:20:59.200 again a shame you had to see me like
05:21:02.200 this oh I I had a bit of a slip up
05:21:05.320 that's all I should have stuck to what I
05:21:08.080 know better
05:21:09.520 no matter I know I I can trust you Gall
05:21:13.840 yes but a good Soul make certain that
05:21:18.600 tanith gets
05:21:20.080 this oh it's it's nothing it's just
05:21:23.360 makes me sick to see her all bent out of
05:21:26.440 shape come on tth back on your high
05:21:29.280 horse where you
05:21:31.360 belong you're able then
05:21:34.798 then I can rest easy my friend
05:21:41.010 [Music]
05:21:42.160 sadly when we deliver his gift tanith
05:21:45.280 shows her true love for Reichard even
05:21:48.520 after his death what is it I have no
05:21:51.958 need of that I must continue devouring
05:21:55.320 my beloved
05:21:57.680 Lord patches is nothing to her we can't
05:22:02.718 help but feel sorry for Patches he
05:22:05.480 finally felt something but his love was
05:22:10.000 requited should he have known better he
05:22:12.718 calls us gullible time and time again
05:22:15.760 but isn't he gble too to think he could
05:22:19.040 compete with Reon join King
05:22:24.558 as whether or not he was gullible is he
05:22:27.798 a hypocrite well thought you'd just help
05:22:31.638 yourself to a man's personal belongings
05:22:34.878 huh patches surely reasons when it's a
05:22:38.080 snake man it's totally different
05:22:41.160 ironically if he hadn't been a scavenger
05:22:43.638 and a coward and risen as a hero he
05:22:46.520 would have likely become one with
05:22:48.000 reichart and then would be becoming one
05:22:51.040 with tanith but it was not Patch's
05:22:54.120 Destiny and patches being patches
05:22:57.558 bounces right back he recovers from his
05:23:00.080 wounds body heart and soul and gets
05:23:03.480 right back to his old tricks but he took
05:23:05.878 a very real risk when he fell for Tannis
05:23:08.878 and this story may help us understand a
05:23:11.480 bit more about patches about the
05:23:13.878 confusing meaning from software may be
05:23:16.080 putting into his recurring appearances
05:23:19.120 patches is a cynic it seems he's had the
05:23:21.760 veil lifted from his eyes he sees the
05:23:24.878 hurt and coldness in the world around
05:23:27.360 him how trusted carers can in fact be
05:23:30.840 some of the worst demons out there he
05:23:33.200 doesn't go mad at the reality in
05:23:34.760 bloodborne because it may not surprise
05:23:37.320 him he expects people to be bad in every
05:23:40.920 game he accurately describes and warns
05:23:43.718 us about the moral shortcomings of other
05:23:45.920 characters well before they cause
05:23:48.160 problems such as Petrus lre yur and more
05:23:53.160 of course he might be right but no one
05:23:55.400 feels warmly about patches either he may
05:23:58.840 feel that in some way everyone is
05:24:01.638 kicking people into holes and stripping
05:24:04.080 their corpses so why not do the same but
05:24:07.240 without the pretense
05:24:08.920 and if it's done to the worst frauds out
05:24:11.240 there all the better his attitude and
05:24:14.040 response at the way the world works is
05:24:16.040 summed up well by one quote in Elden
05:24:18.680 ring work to the Bone by their high and
05:24:21.680 mighty Lord only to be thrown out with
05:24:24.360 the
05:24:25.840 rubbish it's the same old story
05:24:28.320 everywhere I
05:24:29.558 go to hell with it all so he chooses to
05:24:33.920 survive as a solitary scavenger and
05:24:36.440 stays safe by not caring for anyone or
05:24:40.120 anything emotions are a risk we get a
05:24:43.440 glimpse at a brutish early form of this
05:24:46.000 mindset with the potential first patches
05:24:49.360 who also happens to be one of the only
05:24:51.400 surviving humans found in
05:24:56.790 [Music]
05:24:58.840 game he thinks everyone is an enemy and
05:25:02.958 he does survive in other games with this
05:25:04.958 approach to the end of the world but
05:25:07.920 while it may be safe patches is alone is
05:25:12.080 this one of from softwares and M zaki's
05:25:14.760 messages that if we turn away from the
05:25:17.320 risk of caring to only see the harsh
05:25:20.080 truth of the world and give back only
05:25:23.040 what the world has given that we might
05:25:25.400 survive like patches but we might find
05:25:28.400 it hard to care again and end up
05:25:32.320 alone being a cynic is safe after all
05:25:36.120 and the alternative can be
05:25:38.878 brutal in the end patches is a mystery
05:25:43.558 but we think maybe he's
05:25:46.520 incapable of not
05:25:52.280 [Applause]
05:25:56.840 caring every great story seems to begin
05:26:00.160 with a
05:26:01.440 snake the Elden ring snake Iceberg goes
05:26:04.520 deep it reaches down past Reichard past
05:26:07.638 dominula and daar past bloodborne and
05:26:10.680 Dark Souls right to the upcoming DLC and
05:26:13.680 even to the Deep Waters of the Gods the
05:26:16.080 godkin apostles and the glowy Queen the
05:26:19.718 sky is familiar to us all as we go
05:26:22.440 deeper we will move into more obscure
05:26:24.520 parts of the mystery that we have
05:26:26.160 uncovered content warning this video
05:26:28.920 contains graphic content that some may
05:26:30.840 find disturbing including real world
05:26:32.920 footage discussions and footage of a
05:26:35.040 sexual nature religion torture and taboo
05:26:38.280 conspiracy theories blood a heavy
05:26:41.200 content warning for those with the fear
05:26:43.160 of snakes there is real footage
05:26:45.320 throughout this video showing every part
05:26:47.240 of the snake in its life cycle the
05:26:49.558 footage is as explicit as nature
05:26:52.638 herself you have been warned also
05:26:56.040 spoilers from start to finish for Elden
05:26:58.480 ring the Dark Souls series and
05:27:02.080 berserk the sky shining down on the
05:27:04.480 iceberg is
05:27:06.440 unclouded the lore in the SK is
05:27:08.600 beautiful there is a lot including the
05:27:11.200 godkin apostles are connected to snakes
05:27:13.760 they have inhuman physiology Rya is
05:27:16.958 Zoras a half snake half human she is
05:27:19.920 somehow connected to Reichard feeding
05:27:21.760 himself to the Great Serpent rikard
05:27:24.240 surprises his Heroes by welcoming them
05:27:26.558 as family together he plans to Devour
05:27:29.600 the very Gods daar got up to some weird
05:27:33.638 stuff there is an egghead King in
05:27:37.400 ancient times there was a religion which
05:27:39.280 worshiped a snake deity at the end of
05:27:42.000 reichard's storyline tanith will
05:27:43.920 eventually eat reichard's dead body but
05:27:46.840 each of these law discoveries alone
05:27:48.480 doesn't give us any answers what is the
05:27:51.400 snake Obsession in this game and what
05:27:53.680 does it mean on the surface of the
05:27:55.878 iceberg we will start to make
05:27:59.480 connections if we draw the threads
05:28:01.638 together do we start to see a pattern
05:28:03.520 emerge just what is the snake in Elden
05:28:06.320 ring on our first play through true we
05:28:08.520 notice snakes but they only confuse us
05:28:11.240 the godkin apostles are in various
05:28:13.000 locations but it seems with little
05:28:15.000 connection the Church of agay and
05:28:17.280 dominula feel worlds apart and the
05:28:19.520 Divine Towers seem to be from a
05:28:21.280 different age altogether why would they
05:28:23.638 skin diar as punishment why is tanith so
05:28:27.120 Charmed with Reichard why are Gladiators
05:28:30.120 riddled with snakes we learn to be wary
05:28:32.958 of the snake like everything else and we
05:28:35.240 complete the game without answers in the
05:28:38.240 second playthrough these Impressions
05:28:39.680 form a clearer image snakes seem
05:28:42.000 unpredictable but some things repeat it
05:28:44.878 can't be random that snake worshippers
05:28:46.680 in dominula and in volcano Mana both
05:28:49.280 seem obsessed with virgins during their
05:28:52.240 festivals the dancing women of dominula
05:28:54.400 dance around the virgins of the village
05:28:56.400 who are dressed in blue and in volcano
05:28:58.878 Mana the unique iron virgins seem much
05:29:01.320 more important than just an enemy the
05:29:03.920 next pattern is the connection between
05:29:05.558 snakes and fighting as a way of life we
05:29:08.360 didn't notice at first because the
05:29:09.920 examples are so far removed but no
05:29:12.080 matter the culture snakes seem to be
05:29:13.920 connected with fighting for power and
05:29:16.280 jeweling the volcano Mana is a place of
05:29:19.240 snakes and might's right is at the core
05:29:21.760 of its culture its members are sent to
05:29:24.280 fight their own eventually Reichard
05:29:26.920 himself will face us seeking power yet
05:29:30.040 if we slay Reichard his followers do not
05:29:32.240 turn on us Bernal for example holds no
05:29:35.360 ill will the strong take
05:29:38.920 such is our code coincidence strikes
05:29:41.680 again with the Gladiators part of a
05:29:43.840 totally different culture they also
05:29:46.000 Jewel and compete in strength they wear
05:29:48.680 snakes snakes even emerge from the rot
05:29:51.480 variants in their grab
05:29:53.120 attacks now another thing comes to the
05:29:55.680 surface we start noticing the snake's
05:29:57.840 connection to eating and hunger
05:30:00.440 reichard's whole existence as a snake is
05:30:02.520 centered on eating he has eaten well now
05:30:06.558 that we start to notice it we we start
05:30:08.280 to remember snake hunger goes way back
05:30:11.080 back through many from software games
05:30:13.638 from primordial serpents to favorite
05:30:16.080 Rings they have always eaten and
05:30:19.480 eaten these patterns are bizarre but are
05:30:22.200 becoming undeniable in the third
05:30:24.680 playthrough some of the deeper patterns
05:30:26.600 emerge there are signs that the ancient
05:30:28.958 past has snakes Twisted through its
05:30:30.958 history they are connected to the Divine
05:30:33.000 Towers where God skins lurk in their
05:30:35.280 depths they are found on the Giant's
05:30:37.360 Forge carved into stone as if warming
05:30:39.920 themselves in the heat the serpent God's
05:30:42.240 curved sword proves there was a serpent
05:30:44.400 religion but it is long forgotten yet
05:30:47.120 today the attitude towards snakes has
05:30:49.240 clearly changed if the ancient past
05:30:51.638 revered the snake it is hated in the
05:30:54.040 modern era the urre citizens cheered as
05:30:56.680 the image of the snake was beaten and
05:30:58.760 battered reichard's once loyal followers
05:31:01.440 attempt to kill him once he becomes the
05:31:03.718 snake slowly we can see this is more
05:31:06.558 than Randomness the these patterns
05:31:08.440 aren't just coincidence the snake's true
05:31:11.000 nature is rearing up in front of us
05:31:13.520 Miyazaki Martin and the team have welded
05:31:16.240 together ideas from myth reality and
05:31:18.958 human nature it has been distilled into
05:31:21.680 a message and this message is found
05:31:24.280 below the
05:31:26.280 surface beneath the surface there is an
05:31:28.840 answer the serpent isn't one of these
05:31:31.080 patterns it is all of them Miyazaki said
05:31:34.480 understanding his message would take
05:31:35.958 several games there were hint about the
05:31:38.360 truth in Elden ring back in Dark Souls 2
05:31:41.120 in the Covetous gold serpent ring gold
05:31:43.958 ring depicting the snake both the
05:31:46.280 servant and manifestation of the god of
05:31:49.520 Desire the snake is the manifestation of
05:31:52.558 animal desires emotions and instincts
05:31:56.200 the serpent is red and one of these
05:31:59.080 desires occurs so frequently alongside
05:32:01.280 the snake it cannot be
05:32:06.440 ignored the first first manifestation of
05:32:08.920 the snake is sexual sex in all its
05:32:11.760 aspects is the snake lust desire passion
05:32:16.440 once we look through this lens Things
05:32:18.320 fall into place Reichard the snake likee
05:32:21.080 Lord is anything but a monk when he met
05:32:24.160 tanith she was a mere dancer not fit for
05:32:27.200 a man of his social standing yet his
05:32:29.638 lust for her was so strong that he made
05:32:31.600 her his consort and his lust may not
05:32:34.320 have stopped there cut content would
05:32:36.958 suggest that r card is not faithful to
05:32:39.080 tanith in the original description for
05:32:41.080 daar's woe it seems daar was a male in
05:32:44.320 the cut item description it says that
05:32:46.440 this man was reichard's Paramore which
05:32:49.080 means a lover taken while married and
05:32:52.240 that isn't all daar is described as one
05:32:55.240 of reichard's paramor rikard is so
05:32:58.360 lustful across Cannon and cut content
05:33:01.160 his transformation into a snake a
05:33:03.000 manifestation of last is a fitting end
05:33:05.878 snakes have the same theme elsewhere in
05:33:07.600 the volcano Mana the iron virgins have
05:33:10.200 snakes coiling around where genitals
05:33:12.360 would be when they charge you this area
05:33:14.638 flies open and snakes burst forth to
05:33:17.480 draw you inside the women of dominula
05:33:20.520 who worship the snake like a posle dance
05:33:22.878 around virgins in their ceremonies
05:33:25.160 virginity is a sexual definition it is
05:33:28.320 not just being lustful that is snakelike
05:33:30.440 being snakelike seems to seduce others
05:33:33.878 only when rikard turns into a snake is
05:33:36.240 tanith truly Charmed by him snake rings
05:33:40.000 always have an attractive power and Rya
05:33:43.240 is the perfect example of serpent
05:33:45.480 passions at work despite or because of
05:33:49.040 her snake nature fans call her the
05:33:51.638 game's best waifu but Miaki Martin and
05:33:55.600 from software have not reinvented the
05:33:57.840 wheel it was for the crime of lust that
05:34:00.040 Medusa was punished with snake hair she
05:34:02.558 had sex with Poseidon in the temple of
05:34:04.840 the Goddess she worshiped Athena she had
05:34:07.480 made made a vow of Chastity to Athena
05:34:09.760 but act like a snake and you will be
05:34:12.000 turned into one daar in the final
05:34:14.840 version of the game is female after her
05:34:17.360 life of wicked Pleasures she has been
05:34:19.798 punished for her snake likee lust just
05:34:22.480 like Medusa since she behaved like a
05:34:24.600 snake her punishment is to become like
05:34:27.040 one and snakes lose their skin the devil
05:34:31.280 may be the most famous cultural Serpent
05:34:34.080 and in the Garden of Eden he is the
05:34:36.200 Seducer of Eve
05:34:38.160 in all cultures the connection of snakes
05:34:40.080 to sex is so common it's almost the rule
05:34:42.878 from the ancient past with the Hindu
05:34:45.000 Sexual Energy Kundalini meaning coiled
05:34:47.878 snake it is literally coiled here to
05:34:51.520 more modern times Miaki has hidden this
05:34:54.680 pattern in Dark Souls too in Dark Souls
05:34:57.360 those corrupted by Passion become like
05:34:59.360 serpents part of seed's motivations for
05:35:02.040 his abductions of women is lust if he is
05:35:04.760 trying to make a dragon through his
05:35:06.320 experiments he is focused on making a
05:35:08.600 female dragon for his own uses the theme
05:35:12.360 continues in the sequel Mitha was the
05:35:14.718 fairest Queen in the land until
05:35:16.958 something unhinged her was it the poison
05:35:19.320 found deep within the Earth or the
05:35:21.400 passion that consumed her heart the
05:35:24.000 queen sought the king's affection even
05:35:26.320 poisoning herself to attain Beauty
05:35:28.558 despite the Monstrous consequences but
05:35:31.200 the true foundation for the snakes
05:35:33.080 infamy are snakes themselves Mother
05:35:35.840 Nature is the true artist if snakes are
05:35:38.638 seen as sexual it is because their
05:35:40.638 mating activities are extreme they rap
05:35:43.638 and constrict each other throughout
05:35:45.760 biting is usual and sometimes they will
05:35:48.240 kill if the mating goes wrong if nothing
05:35:50.760 does go wrong mating can last for hours
05:35:53.798 but that is just for one partner males
05:35:56.440 and females can have many mating
05:35:58.440 partners and so the whole process can
05:36:01.080 seem to never end but there is a greater
05:36:04.360 animal desire hunger all consuming
05:36:08.120 hunger is the snake pror Reichard was a
05:36:11.320 greedy man but this was just a prologue
05:36:14.360 since his transformation he has gorged
05:36:16.558 himself like a [ __ ] Goose swelling in
05:36:19.760 size until he fills the core of a
05:36:21.878 volcano yet he still hungers for his
05:36:24.558 greatest meal yet the very Gods the
05:36:27.920 Serpent's gluttony is in the game's
05:36:29.638 opening sequence a snake is eating rard
05:36:32.680 severed head and this snake is normal it
05:36:35.958 was no great snake at at all but now
05:36:39.320 it's a wonder it doesn't collapse under
05:36:41.000 its own weight the real snake is the
05:36:43.878 king of hunger it's practically nothing
05:36:46.160 but a huge mouth and one long horrific
05:36:49.000 stomach capable of digesting anything it
05:36:52.040 opens its mouth impossibly wide for each
05:36:54.280 meal its Juran stomach stretched to the
05:36:57.000 Limit and just like Reichard they can
05:36:59.638 become a victim of their own greed and
05:37:02.520 snakes truly never stop growing growth
05:37:05.718 only slows with age some some snakes
05:37:08.040 have reached unbelievable sizes the
05:37:10.600 extinct Titan Boa was so big it would
05:37:13.200 struggle to Slither its 50ft body
05:37:15.638 through an open doorway Reichard is not
05:37:18.120 from software's only hungry snake the
05:37:21.000 God skins have their teeth and Jaws
05:37:23.520 fully modeled and rendered in game this
05:37:26.520 is incredibly unique perhaps after
05:37:29.240 skinning their victims they eat the
05:37:31.760 remaining flesh a cut boss from
05:37:34.080 bloodborne has an attack just like
05:37:36.040 Reichard it swallows us whole and the
05:37:39.200 serpent God in searo tries endlessly to
05:37:42.120 consume us there is another desire that
05:37:45.480 consumes the snake competition in nature
05:37:49.558 snake competition is violent their
05:37:51.920 fights are so hypnotically Savage that
05:37:54.080 humans have always forced snakes to
05:37:56.040 fight and bet on the results Reichard is
05:37:59.280 obsessed with competition ultimately he
05:38:01.718 wants to beat the very Gods the
05:38:03.878 Gladiators join in violent competition
05:38:06.638 both dressed in snakes only one survives
05:38:10.000 and before becoming a recusant the
05:38:12.080 volcano Mana wants proof we can kill our
05:38:14.480 own to join their Clan you must compete
05:38:17.280 as ruthlessly as the
05:38:19.400 snake what do we feel approaching a fog
05:38:22.160 gate as a boss Towers over us what do we
05:38:26.000 feel when a snake crosses our path fear
05:38:30.320 but usually all the snake wants is to
05:38:33.120 escape fear is a snake's most common
05:38:35.958 motivation for attack and so the snake
05:38:38.240 is also a manifestation of fear and pain
05:38:41.760 the volcano Mana drips in both torture
05:38:45.360 vicious experiments on Alban oric crying
05:38:48.040 abductor virgins reichard's growth comes
05:38:51.160 with pain a pain Reichard takes parting
05:38:54.240 he may stay asleep simply to avoid the
05:38:56.520 pain of his own growth after all his
05:38:58.958 guts have literally opened from the
05:39:01.240 inside the snake has good reason to be
05:39:03.920 afraid with no real armor the snake
05:39:06.400 bleeds easily
05:39:07.878 even the Great Snake learns to fear us
05:39:10.440 and so often the snake is too scared to
05:39:13.400 fight
05:39:15.040 fair are you afraid to fight me yourself
05:39:18.000 you cowardly snake a snake am I perhaps
05:39:23.360 you'd like to see how snake like I can
05:39:28.400 [Music]
05:39:29.718 be we now have the basic parts of the
05:39:32.400 snake but the snake can coil itself up
05:39:35.478 in all sorts of confusing ways is none
05:39:38.240 of the passions are an island what
05:39:40.360 happens when competition fixates on
05:39:42.478 material wealth what happens when this
05:39:45.080 combines with gluttony these coil
05:39:47.680 desires appear a lot in from software
05:39:50.040 games the gold serpent Rings boost our
05:39:52.798 treasure finding framp hungers for
05:39:55.280 material possessions and SE piles up
05:39:58.360 Treasures in his archives the most
05:40:00.520 valuable were pillaged in ancient
05:40:03.120 culture this connection holds the
05:40:05.160 Chinese zodiac predicts riches will come
05:40:07.600 easy if you're born in the year of the
05:40:10.000 snake and in modern storytelling
05:40:12.878 Hogwarts competitive and materialistic
05:40:15.400 students assorted to
05:40:18.840 slithering but this is just one coil of
05:40:21.478 the snake what happens when competition
05:40:23.798 combines with lust snakes fight so
05:40:26.638 ruthlessly for a mate it can lead to
05:40:28.920 death and it doesn't stop there even
05:40:31.320 once the chance to mate has been one
05:40:33.400 others will try to interrupt or take
05:40:35.400 their chances once a su has left
05:40:37.878 so un coils the next messy snake likee
05:40:40.878 pattern beware my lord of jealousy it is
05:40:44.478 the greeneyed monster which doth mock
05:40:47.120 the meat it feeds on the snake is the
05:40:50.280 greeneyed monster and its solution for
05:40:52.718 jealousy is brutal it keeps its mate
05:40:55.520 from others with hooked barbs to
05:40:58.280 maintain connection perhaps Juno hoslo
05:41:01.718 has become a victim of the mana's
05:41:03.360 jealousy if they can't have him no one
05:41:06.280 can competition and an obsession with
05:41:09.320 your own pain brings Revenge the snake
05:41:13.000 always Strikes Back tanith warns us
05:41:16.478 defeat is not the
05:41:18.200 end he will one day Rise
05:41:21.760 Again stronger we have seen lust
05:41:24.958 combined with gluttony but what if pain
05:41:27.520 gets involved the activities of the Mana
05:41:30.280 are warped to say the least why would
05:41:33.520 Giza a man of power have his face and
05:41:36.360 arms wrapped as though he was injured
05:41:38.718 tanith too is covered the cut content
05:41:41.840 daar Had A peculiar habit he would test
05:41:44.840 new methods of torture first upon
05:41:47.200 himself making a gift of his pain and
05:41:49.878 firsthand knowledge to the one he loved
05:41:52.798 it seems as though pain in the volcano
05:41:54.718 Mana is not that far from
05:41:57.200 [Music]
05:41:58.680 pleasure and competition with Hunger
05:42:02.160 snakes are a rare animal in nature as
05:42:04.760 many are cannibals their hunger and
05:42:07.280 competition is so extreme that they will
05:42:09.360 eat their own kind they gorge on the
05:42:11.920 bodies of snakes that look just like
05:42:14.040 them and the greatest cannibal snake is
05:42:17.040 the king cobra how fitting that Reichard
05:42:19.958 the human who has turned to eating his
05:42:21.680 own is now the king of serpents in the
05:42:24.958 world of snakes the strongest eat the
05:42:27.840 rest the snake is all the red hot
05:42:30.920 instincts and all their confusing
05:42:34.040 combinations the snake is in Godfrey
05:42:36.320 when he fights and when he begets Godwin
05:42:39.440 the snake is in ranala when rigan leaves
05:42:41.718 her and she seees with jealousy and the
05:42:44.360 snake is there when morot cowed in fear
05:42:47.320 chained in his cell snakes are all of
05:42:50.400 these passions and desires but why we
05:42:53.680 have to go deeper deeper down to the
05:42:56.440 body of the
05:42:58.280 iceberg the body of the iceberg starts
05:43:00.760 to take form and we haven't been seeing
05:43:03.000 the whole picture as we move deeper down
05:43:05.400 the snake mystery a question comes to
05:43:07.798 mind why does pain or pleasure even
05:43:10.680 exist why is the snake and its passions
05:43:13.040 in us at all the snake is much more than
05:43:16.120 sex violence and rock and roll what are
05:43:18.798 these passions for what did daar's
05:43:21.558 adultery and wicked pleasure
05:43:24.878 bring if we follow the consequences of
05:43:27.558 lust we can understand in every example
05:43:30.360 of sex in Elden ring children are the
05:43:33.000 common thread this seems obvious but
05:43:35.520 remember sex and birth the ancient
05:43:37.718 history in the lands between sex is
05:43:40.120 nothing without fertility look closer
05:43:43.320 the snakes that wind around the genitals
05:43:45.120 of the iron virgin are not the only
05:43:46.920 snakes she wears there is a belt of
05:43:49.320 snakes wrapped around her waist a
05:43:51.798 universal symbol of fertility the
05:43:55.080 dominula women dress The Virgins in
05:43:56.920 flowers that celebrate New Life they
05:43:59.638 dance and pray to their snake priests
05:44:01.558 for fertility they hope for children as
05:44:04.600 part of losing their virginity the serp
05:44:07.320 amnon on the altar is used in a birthing
05:44:10.320 ritual and the glowm mind Queen swaddled
05:44:13.400 her Apostles however they made they are
05:44:16.320 her
05:44:17.240 children lust was just the beginning of
05:44:19.958 the iceberg the iceberg is in fact much
05:44:22.600 larger and this is just one of the
05:44:25.040 passions what about the rest what is the
05:44:27.798 snake really the answer looks like a
05:44:31.040 snake in rikard's Boss room we find it
05:44:34.680 it is there in dominula in their head
05:44:37.040 hair and in the symbol on their clothes
05:44:39.920 it is wielded by the godkin Apostle they
05:44:42.478 worship in his
05:44:44.638 attack and twisted into the godslayer
05:44:47.760 seal it is in the snake arrows and it is
05:44:51.478 in reichard's taker's Cameo formed by
05:44:54.840 two
05:44:56.040 snakes the spiral once you see it it is
05:45:00.000 everywhere on the jar boys and the jar
05:45:02.638 cannon in the plats of the ancestral
05:45:05.160 followers it is in the prince of death's
05:45:07.558 staff and the sword that Radigan becomes
05:45:10.558 it is on mogs
05:45:12.400 robes in
05:45:14.200 spells and on the side of the tibia
05:45:16.558 Mariners boat bogut's pot it is part of
05:45:20.600 the Oracle Envoy horns as they play
05:45:23.160 music for a new age and when we finally
05:45:26.600 see melan's Hidden Eye at its Center is
05:45:30.120 a
05:45:31.160 spiral the spiral is a cycle it is what
05:45:34.638 the ancestral worship and what Marg hope
05:45:37.120 to begin with his new Dynasty it is
05:45:39.958 creation from destruction competition
05:45:43.160 and Discovery rot and
05:45:46.798 growth life from Death the spiral is the
05:45:51.638 true snake all these Cycles are
05:45:55.000 processes and all of them have two sides
05:45:58.600 like two snakes competing
05:46:04.040 [Music]
05:46:15.360 the spiral in the lands between always
05:46:17.558 fits with this principle and outside the
05:46:19.760 lands between it goes even deeper
05:46:22.360 Chinese mythology has serpent-like
05:46:24.240 deities called Nua and fushi who created
05:46:27.760 almost everything their form two snakes
05:46:31.798 intertwining Miyazaki may have made K
05:46:34.320 and framp in their image they fight for
05:46:36.520 different things and yet they come
05:46:38.478 together in the end two in one a process
05:46:42.600 a cycle like how the cadua staff of
05:46:45.440 Hermes represented balance balance is
05:46:48.200 only achieved with
05:46:50.718 opposites the Helix across human culture
05:46:53.878 has been paired with the cycles of life
05:46:55.920 and death so when the molecule at the
05:46:58.320 center of life was discovered it seemed
05:47:00.520 meant to be that it took the shape of a
05:47:04.958 spiral the snake is much more than
05:47:07.760 Instinct the snake is the manifestation
05:47:10.878 of survival everything we thought it was
05:47:13.760 are just its tools its tools of survival
05:47:17.520 we can understand this idea better by
05:47:19.400 looking at the snake's most paradoxical
05:47:21.760 tool in every Souls born game snakes are
05:47:24.680 associated with undeath snakes borrow
05:47:27.798 beneath the Earth and back much like a
05:47:30.040 buried Undead returns to the surface but
05:47:32.958 it is much more than this similarity
05:47:40.610 [Music]
05:47:41.920 never why do volcano Mana perfumers
05:47:44.760 study snakes to learn
05:47:46.958 revivification which means to give new
05:47:49.400 life or Vigor to why does GIS a
05:47:52.638 necromancer hold company with a serpent
05:47:56.240 the serpent is the symbol of undeath
05:47:58.558 because true long-term survival must
05:48:01.200 survive through death the snake uses
05:48:04.558 death to live whatever living thing you
05:48:07.478 choose no individual survives and yet
05:48:10.520 life goes on not only that animals adapt
05:48:13.958 through death evolution of a species is
05:48:16.400 a modern idea but Improvement through
05:48:18.558 destruction is an old one and so the
05:48:21.240 snake embodies this truth of survival it
05:48:24.080 lives and grows through death its most
05:48:26.920 paradoxical tool this explains turning
05:48:29.600 to the snake for the secrets of life
05:48:31.680 from Death by understanding the snake
05:48:34.000 GIS may be able to bring back his family
05:48:36.798 and perfumer Karman may be able to renew
05:48:39.320 himself
05:48:40.360 indefinitely the same connection holds
05:48:42.680 beyond the game Aus learns how to live
05:48:45.360 forever by watching serpents bring each
05:48:47.638 other back to life and Voldemort is
05:48:50.600 snake-like because to cheat death he
05:48:53.360 gave some of himself to the serpent the
05:48:56.160 tool of death is why the snake is carved
05:48:58.360 on the Giant's Forge both the snake and
05:49:00.878 fire are red both are Life Death Cycles
05:49:04.160 destructive and productive both break
05:49:07.000 down and Forge a new so the two seek
05:49:10.558 each other the volcano is also like the
05:49:13.200 snake full of fiery passion but each
05:49:16.440 death is a sacrifice for New
05:49:19.558 Life the partnership between snakes and
05:49:22.240 Flame is still at the center of Elden
05:49:24.440 Ring's Story the one who walks alongside
05:49:28.400 fle shall one day meet the road of
05:49:31.760 destined death the snake is Undead in
05:49:35.240 another way they share their skin they
05:49:37.920 leave behind a corpse of themselves to
05:49:40.280 birth themselves a new bright and
05:49:42.478 beautiful this idea is found everywhere
05:49:44.798 in Elden ring we find a shed skin in the
05:49:47.320 temple of agay it has a space just where
05:49:50.320 reichard's face appears on the Great
05:49:52.520 Serpent Reichard must grow with the
05:49:55.478 serpent and so he must be part of its
05:49:57.958 shedding cycle when we meet the Great
05:50:00.120 Serpent there are strips of skin hanging
05:50:02.280 off it remnants from its last shed
05:50:05.160 looking closely we can see rikard's face
05:50:07.558 is built up in layers ready to be shed
05:50:10.478 as he grows one day after rikard has
05:50:13.360 shed his face countless times his face
05:50:15.718 will be like the face of a mountain life
05:50:18.600 from Death is celebrated by all snake
05:50:20.920 worshippers the dominula women dance
05:50:23.160 next to perfect examples of life from
05:50:25.600 Death windmills to Mill the life-giving
05:50:28.760 grain a little of the wind must die and
05:50:32.320 what is the symbol of the godkin
05:50:33.840 Apostles the coming together of a spire
05:50:36.638 spiral death closes the cycle to form a
05:50:40.040 seed for the
05:50:41.600 future now the simpl snake passions
05:50:44.200 become clear they are methods to stay
05:50:46.840 alive in a ruthless world the mouth
05:50:49.400 stretches and the stomach swells but
05:50:51.798 what if it wasn't gluttony but
05:50:53.760 desperation the snake Gorges itself at
05:50:56.200 every opportunity but opportunity is
05:50:58.558 scarce In the Jungle the Dark Souls 2
05:51:01.400 serpent ring says greed is traditionally
05:51:03.958 viewed as a vice but only a fool that's
05:51:06.200 that r Ru a good opportunity greed
05:51:09.160 wouldn't exist if it didn't help us
05:51:11.478 survive the symbol of the snake living
05:51:13.920 and renewing itself indefinitely is the
05:51:16.520 uroboros the snake does this by eating
05:51:19.360 itself feasting on itself to grow a
05:51:22.920 new this magic is elsewhere in the lands
05:51:25.718 between the serpentine land octopus eats
05:51:28.840 their own limbs to regenerate Health
05:51:32.040 Reichard in an inspired move puts
05:51:34.718 himself into this Loop by by feeding
05:51:37.120 himself to the serpent countless Heroes
05:51:39.680 then are eaten and live in Reichard
05:51:42.360 until Reichard himself is eaten by
05:51:44.638 tanith she feasts on her true love so
05:51:47.558 that he may live inside her if he does
05:51:50.440 survive he may still achieve his dream
05:51:52.760 to eventually consume the entire world
05:51:56.280 every act that aids fertility and birth
05:51:58.958 is the snake when a snake spirals with a
05:52:01.558 mate it produces offspring who surviv
05:52:03.920 the parents lust jealousy Envy are all
05:52:07.680 just tools if they didn't work to
05:52:09.680 survive they wouldn't exist for the
05:52:11.920 snake is not just phallic it is an
05:52:14.200 umbilical cord the connection to our
05:52:16.760 ancestors even in sex itself orgasm is
05:52:20.120 called The Little Death the tool of fear
05:52:23.638 is a Basic Instinct the snake hides with
05:52:26.440 camouflage borrows under the ground and
05:52:29.080 Bluffs by hissing or lunging but fear is
05:52:32.440 just a survival tool to tell you when
05:52:34.360 odds aren't in your favor how ever big
05:52:36.878 it grows the snake is always wary ryar
05:52:40.160 doesn't dare show his face outside his
05:52:42.400 volcano his manner is an insular Place
05:52:45.558 only his serpent men roam outside and he
05:52:47.958 doesn't even trust his Heroes with the
05:52:49.798 truth reichard's fear of desertion is so
05:52:52.638 strong only tanith knows his secret
05:52:55.360 after all even his followers tried to
05:52:57.558 kill him to reveal himself to every
05:52:59.840 faction would be like a snake slithering
05:53:02.160 onto a beach the birds would forget
05:53:04.240 their differences and turn on the
05:53:07.160 serpent so Reichard bides his time
05:53:10.440 afraid as every snake is but fear helps
05:53:14.040 in the
05:53:15.400 jungle to shed the skin takes friction
05:53:19.000 and for the strongest survivors to prove
05:53:21.160 themselves you need competition real
05:53:23.878 snakes compete in spirals fighting over
05:53:26.638 territory or mates the snake who admits
05:53:29.160 defeat will respect the strength of the
05:53:30.920 winner and leave him the spoils for a
05:53:33.478 while at least we see this in the
05:53:35.840 volcano manner competition helps the
05:53:38.200 heroes rise to the top the coil Shield
05:53:40.920 puts it best the snake on the shield
05:53:43.478 rises above its peers as a particularly
05:53:46.000 showy specimen tanith believes in snake
05:53:48.878 likee competition so deeply that when we
05:53:51.160 tell her we have slain her true love she
05:53:53.440 says it's true then you've defeated our
05:53:57.000 Lord no I must thank you our Lord was
05:54:01.320 yet weak you have taught us that
05:54:03.878 competition is an invisible cycle that
05:54:06.760 the best the whole becomes stronger
05:54:08.840 despite the destruction along the way
05:54:11.120 the ancestral followers worship multiple
05:54:13.240 ancestral spirits but only one is King
05:54:16.600 Godfrey has the same attitude thy
05:54:19.958 strength beit the
05:54:23.638 crown even reichart has earned his crown
05:54:26.638 as king of the snakes but according to
05:54:28.798 the law of the snakes we take his crown
05:54:31.638 and so his followers respect us for it
05:54:34.878 you killed rar
05:54:37.120 I Harbor you no ill will the strong
05:54:40.798 take such is our code competition helps
05:54:45.120 survival from basic animal Dynamics to
05:54:47.920 complex systems destruction is always
05:54:51.160 part of the
05:54:52.920 process if snake likee instincts didn't
05:54:55.478 push individuals to risk themselves for
05:54:57.798 the sake of greed the process stops
05:55:00.080 working no competition brings nothing
05:55:02.958 and too much competition corrodes the
05:55:05.080 participants away but the right amount
05:55:07.240 of competition is a creative Force the
05:55:09.958 Venom of the snake in the right dosage
05:55:12.638 is medicine masaki's Inspirations have
05:55:15.680 the same message in berserk guts and
05:55:18.120 griffith are in competition they seem to
05:55:20.400 be two halves and it is not the first
05:55:22.840 time similar pairs have battled this
05:55:25.638 cycle seems to repeat again and again as
05:55:28.600 though the pain and struggle of their
05:55:29.958 suffering is all for a purpose to make
05:55:32.558 something greater we haven't dared read
05:55:35.520 the secret chapter of Berserk but our
05:55:37.638 intuition tells us it reveals the same
05:55:39.958 philosophy the power of competition even
05:55:42.520 creates the spiral world tree in a fight
05:55:45.360 between Griffith and the skull Knight it
05:55:47.320 is the destructive power of a sword
05:55:49.320 attack that creates it all these tools
05:55:52.760 that are the snake have immense value
05:55:55.360 and so the ancient cultures in the lands
05:55:57.280 between slowly began to worship it in
05:56:00.120 snake likee ways the dominula serpent
05:56:03.120 worshippers celebrate skinning as part
05:56:05.280 of their violent f festival and on the
05:56:07.760 altars dedicated to Alay the serpent
05:56:10.440 flesh is placed but why do the snake
05:56:13.160 worshippers celebrate all this pain why
05:56:15.760 is sacrifice always present it is
05:56:18.478 because they know what the snake truly
05:56:20.760 is pain may be bad but without it all
05:56:24.160 would be lost it is the sacrifice for
05:56:27.040 something greater as humans learn the
05:56:29.600 confusing but undeniable connections of
05:56:32.280 life and the horrific Necessities needed
05:56:34.558 to sustain it all of must be worshiped
05:56:38.000 because death brings life and so in time
05:56:42.360 every great cycle of life will be
05:56:44.280 worshiped as a God all in
05:56:48.680 Balance everything you see exists
05:56:51.680 together in a delicate balance as king
05:56:54.920 you need to understand that balance and
05:56:57.080 respect all the creatures from The
05:56:59.040 Crawling ant to the leaping antalope but
05:57:02.120 Dad don't we eat the antalope yes Simba
05:57:04.840 but let me explain when we die our
05:57:07.558 bodies become the grass and the antelope
05:57:10.320 eat the grass and so we are all
05:57:14.320 connected in the great circle of
05:57:17.478 life the Giants God will only give his
05:57:20.360 Aid if you burn a part of yourself the
05:57:23.478 disgust of rot doesn't prevent its
05:57:25.958 worship and in our own time MOG believes
05:57:28.920 the gift and loss of blood that takes
05:57:31.120 part in death birth and consumption may
05:57:34.120 be its own cycle Worthy of worship the
05:57:38.240 religions of the lands between
05:57:40.360 understand the idea of balance of dosage
05:57:44.718 a snake's venom can kill but in the
05:57:47.160 right amount it is
05:57:49.240 medicine however the point of balance is
05:57:51.718 always changing the snake in alchemy is
05:57:54.440 also associated with sulfur and sulfur
05:57:57.760 is volatile just like the snake but this
05:58:00.958 element is also seen as transformative
05:58:03.920 the Bas snake can change into a higher
05:58:06.680 form all of the snakes processes are
05:58:09.558 survival but in time they can work so
05:58:12.718 well such an aim is surpassed sometimes
05:58:16.320 things can be the same and the same
05:58:18.638 until they change deeper down the
05:58:20.920 iceberg we find snakes are the
05:58:23.040 beginnings of something else the snake
05:58:26.120 can become a victim of its own success
05:58:28.718 snake methods work but they have worked
05:58:30.840 so well that it starts to become crowded
05:58:33.520 with such high numbers what has been so
05:58:35.638 successful ful now stops working
05:58:38.400 reproduction the essential tool of the
05:58:40.638 snake can now cause populations to sore
05:58:43.040 so high that there isn't enough food
05:58:45.638 this same high population means lust
05:58:48.000 brings disease like never before
05:58:50.878 competition worked well selecting for
05:58:52.878 the best but now eating another doesn't
05:58:55.440 go unseen as it did in the jungle
05:58:58.080 suddenly there are witnesses everywhere
05:59:00.558 who will turn on the murderer now the
05:59:03.120 snake can have too much of a good thing
05:59:05.798 and can die from it just as the snake
05:59:08.320 seeks heat to warm itself too much heat
05:59:11.360 can kill
05:59:12.900 [Music]
05:59:16.920 it bizarrely the snake passions have
05:59:19.760 created so much success they begin to
05:59:22.080 cause their own redundancy they are less
05:59:24.760 adaptive to the environment these
05:59:26.958 passions must now be held back so a new
05:59:31.120 spiral emerges the snake passions meet a
05:59:34.520 new resistance and and like two roots of
05:59:37.280 creation from these forces arise
05:59:41.080 Society it forms like a great tree under
05:59:44.400 whose shade all can rest where everyone
05:59:47.120 can be sheltered from The Wind by its
05:59:49.000 trunk fed by its fruit and can climb its
05:59:52.080 branches escaping the old predators of
05:59:54.478 the Jungle now we are no longer the
05:59:56.798 victims of constant fear or hunger that
05:59:59.320 were the daily realities in the wild it
06:00:02.040 is as though we no longer have to crawl
06:00:03.798 in the dust to survive we are allowed to
06:00:06.520 walk with our heads held high walking
06:00:09.760 has
06:00:10.930 [Music]
06:00:13.638 dignity yes dignity this new stage is
06:00:17.478 like a miracle it feels impossible when
06:00:19.840 we start with such wild raw materials
06:00:23.240 the magic of how Society arises is
06:00:25.638 summed up perfectly by the companion jar
06:00:29.000 though the jars are brought to life by
06:00:31.040 human flesh and blood they are all
06:00:33.558 rather kindly folk perhaps they were
06:00:36.160 made to be better than their innards
06:00:38.958 together they are more than the sum of
06:00:40.798 their parts and this benefit of coming
06:00:43.360 together the benefits of society charms
06:00:46.240 the snake now in this emergent
06:00:49.040 environment there are new incentives we
06:00:51.760 become more Soulful and less instinctive
06:00:54.840 there is less and less brutality the
06:00:57.120 snake is no longer in the dust it is
06:00:59.600 rising off the ground children are no
06:01:02.240 longer abandoned at Birth as the snake
06:01:04.638 abandons her eggs children are raised by
06:01:07.360 their parents and know their mothers
06:01:09.840 Bach is closer to Human Than Rya he
06:01:12.558 knows his mother but she does not the
06:01:15.920 individual is not so competitive it
06:01:18.440 cannot work so directly for personal
06:01:20.558 gain it cannot behave so territorially
06:01:23.680 the individual now finds greater benefit
06:01:25.958 working for the group food is gathered
06:01:28.440 together and shared this is so much
06:01:30.878 easier than the way of the Jungle and
06:01:32.958 everyone benefits just like the Fire
06:01:35.558 Within the forge the power of the snake
06:01:38.200 is tamed now under the shelter of this
06:01:41.200 great tree intellect can explore the
06:01:43.638 mysteries of the world with space from
06:01:46.240 the immediate needs of the Jungle we can
06:01:48.400 discover its beauty and its rules
06:01:51.478 methods are found for further growth
06:01:53.718 producing food becomes Farms our Rivers
06:01:57.000 Water Supplies and the land itself is
06:01:59.520 not our Master but a tool roads towns
06:02:03.680 and cities grow and multiply
06:02:06.400 with more and more abundance works of
06:02:08.638 art are created and enjoyed the academy
06:02:11.718 learns from the stars the capital
06:02:14.160 develops culture and ceremony the world
06:02:17.200 has changed in this new world if you can
06:02:20.280 Master the snakes within you then The
06:02:22.240 Spoils of society are yours we see this
06:02:25.360 symbolized in game and in our own world
06:02:28.520 snakes guard treasure and it's an
06:02:30.600 analogy for overcoming our based desires
06:02:33.040 to achieve what we truly want there
06:02:35.840 there is a repeated depiction of
06:02:37.440 gripping one or two snakes in your hands
06:02:40.080 to symbolize overcoming animal Instinct
06:02:43.120 Mastery of oneself and the Philosopher's
06:02:46.080 Stone which is seen as the key to the
06:02:48.120 greatest Enlightenment is guarded by a
06:02:51.000 snake in the capital of landal if you
06:02:53.798 want to show just how far from snake
06:02:56.040 passions you are you trade the showy red
06:02:58.600 of the Jungle a display of animal force
06:03:01.200 and Instinct for a cool rational blue
06:03:04.638 you were displaying your commitment to
06:03:06.600 this new world this new world seems to
06:03:09.958 have a kind of Soul or flame a kind of
06:03:14.000 life or sun and each of us adds a piece
06:03:18.000 of their own fire to it and from this
06:03:20.680 act everyone can be warmed by a shared
06:03:24.040 sun and so the wearers of blue whose
06:03:27.360 ancestors worshiped the snake as Divine
06:03:30.120 now turn away from the serpent but the
06:03:33.080 snake is not so easily tamed the snake
06:03:36.120 is far too dangerous for that just like
06:03:39.240 metal that is melted in the Forge the
06:03:41.638 snake can slip through any Gap if the
06:03:44.680 snake's nature is uncontrolled it will
06:03:46.638 wreak havoc lust Envy violence these
06:03:50.798 things can blot out the sun whether
06:03:53.240 small scale violence or widespread
06:03:55.878 famine it wouldn't take much for the
06:03:57.920 wheels to come off the gaps in the Forge
06:04:00.680 must be closed tightly snake Behavior
06:04:04.040 must be prevented and so it is punished
06:04:08.360 instead of individuals seeking Revenge
06:04:10.920 society as a whole will now punish those
06:04:13.200 who missbehave but the greatest
06:04:15.160 punishments of society are not clearly
06:04:17.400 defined they are simply part of the
06:04:19.520 invisible societal fabric the fear of
06:04:22.360 rejection by your group by friends and
06:04:25.958 family
06:04:27.478 embarrassment shame these regulate the
06:04:30.958 snake within us whether it's a partner
06:04:33.478 your role in society a child child like
06:04:36.638 a tide these compel you to behave be it
06:04:40.638 as a tailor or a
06:04:43.718 Lord and so the concept of evil arises
06:04:47.798 in this new world in the animal world
06:04:50.400 there was only effective and ineffective
06:04:53.520 life or death now behavior is also
06:04:56.718 measured by how it helps or harms
06:04:59.200 Society these attitudes emerge without
06:05:01.718 consensus or even a knowledge of why but
06:05:05.240 their power is phenomenal the thread
06:05:08.360 that connects evil to society can be
06:05:10.638 found in myth but it is subtle the name
06:05:14.718 nidhog the serpent that tries to
06:05:16.798 undermine Society became a Nordic slur
06:05:20.240 this slur meant someone who has obtained
06:05:22.360 the status of a villain or who has lost
06:05:24.840 their honor both Concepts would be
06:05:27.000 totally alien to a predator in the
06:05:29.320 jungle evil is part of society it didn't
06:05:33.400 exist before it slowly as the snakes are
06:05:36.718 more and more controlled we are less and
06:05:39.440 less adapted to deal with them so the
06:05:41.840 snake and its passions come to be
06:05:43.760 greatly feared in others and yourself
06:05:47.520 this comes slowly for the snake has long
06:05:49.840 Been Loved but eventually the monkeys
06:05:52.280 climb higher up the tree no longer is
06:05:55.040 cold or starvation the killer under the
06:05:57.638 shade and protection of the tree many
06:06:00.080 dangers are removed but the dangers of
06:06:02.638 each other are not the snake in one
06:06:05.718 another is now the top predator in time
06:06:08.920 punishment and social attitudes are
06:06:10.718 effective fear turns to hate and hate
06:06:13.840 turns to disgust the snake that crawls
06:06:16.240 on its stomach has no dignity and the
06:06:18.638 snake-like passions are seen as low and
06:06:21.160 vulgar our disgust for the snake can be
06:06:23.680 so extreme that it doesn't matter if
06:06:25.478 someone is working for the greater good
06:06:27.360 if you show snake-like Behavior no
06:06:29.440 matter the aim you will be cast out from
06:06:31.798 society whatever reichard's intentions
06:06:34.600 the story was the same as the Lord lost
06:06:37.400 his dignity so too did these Knights
06:06:40.000 lose their Master now with the worship
06:06:42.680 of the snake a distant memory there is a
06:06:44.760 new change the complexity of the Jungle
06:06:47.320 is forgotten under the shade of the tree
06:06:50.040 the tree is so beautiful it seems to be
06:06:52.240 the only thing and a new religion arises
06:06:56.120 not worshiping snakes death and life
06:06:59.000 fertility and birth rot growth strength
06:07:03.400 but simply one God the god God of order
06:07:06.958 the order that can be seen all around in
06:07:09.680 society now the snake can be more than
06:07:12.280 punished it can become an object of
06:07:14.200 religious hatred the snake becomes a
06:07:16.638 cult and Pagan now you cannot Escape
06:07:19.638 your crimes even after death if your
06:07:22.200 fellow man doesn't punish you God will
06:07:25.080 hell is waiting for those who behave
06:07:26.920 like a snake ancient Norse poetry tells
06:07:30.000 of a snake Hall in hell that punishes
06:07:32.600 those who behaved shamefully in life
06:07:34.958 there is a serpent there who eats the
06:07:36.718 bodies of men perjured and wolfish
06:07:39.320 murderers and the one who seduces the
06:07:42.360 snake is no longer Godlike but a demon
06:07:46.000 there's a demon inside of you it's
06:07:48.160 inside both of
06:07:53.760 you look everyone this is what hatred
06:07:56.798 looks like this is what it does when it
06:07:58.400 catches hold of you it's eaing me alive
06:08:01.080 and very soon now it will kill me fear
06:08:03.680 and anger only make it grow faster
06:08:06.120 and these ideas become fixed in the
06:08:08.000 minds those born to this culture have
06:08:10.280 never walked in the jungle or even seen
06:08:12.638 a snake these ideas of sin root so
06:08:15.638 deeply that they become foundational in
06:08:17.558 the mind even those who rationally wish
06:08:19.878 to turn against the rules will struggle
06:08:21.840 with the effects of guilt and shame
06:08:24.160 imagine one lives under a tyrannical
06:08:25.958 regime with a king who the nation
06:08:27.798 believes is placed there by God to work
06:08:30.280 to overthrow the Tyrant will be seen as
06:08:32.360 Pure Evil by the Believers and perhaps
06:08:35.080 by part of yourself whether iard is
06:08:37.760 Justified in his beliefs you can decide
06:08:39.840 for yourself but he knew that the
06:08:41.718 disgust he would cause would be so
06:08:43.478 extreme that he even made a tonic of
06:08:45.440 forgetfulness for his love to forget him
06:08:48.400 the road of blasphemy is a hard one
06:08:51.280 indeed Now new religious Concepts come
06:08:54.040 into play reproduction is no longer of
06:08:56.520 the Jungle marriage develops they are
06:08:59.878 spiritual and religious ceremonies where
06:09:02.000 people are joined for Life Concepts
06:09:04.320 around birth that had never had meaning
06:09:06.080 before such as maidenhood and soulmates
06:09:08.638 come into existence as the great one
06:09:11.320 religion gains force it seems the tree
06:09:13.760 is growing Higher and Higher and we can
06:09:16.360 keep climbing as long as enough members
06:09:18.400 contribute to its growth there is now
06:09:20.760 kindness Health and Longevity like never
06:09:23.798 before the Brilliance of invention and
06:09:26.200 the ease of life is like nothing that
06:09:27.958 the jungle could have dreamed of the Sun
06:09:30.798 or the tree exist and don't exist in a
06:09:34.040 beautiful miracle that seems almost like
06:09:36.638 heaven we want to climb further to this
06:09:39.000 heaven to touch the Divine but this
06:09:41.878 desire can go too far the fear can
06:09:44.718 become Obsession we start to avoid
06:09:47.160 looking at any parts of the snake
06:09:49.680 disgust turns to denial the snake is not
06:09:52.400 shown the snake is not talked about the
06:09:54.920 snake is not acknowledged it is not part
06:09:57.958 of us it never was we climb higher into
06:10:01.280 the tree never looking down now we want
06:10:04.638 the sun to shine shine forever an
06:10:06.840 endless day the old principles of
06:10:09.638 balance are denied some begin to say
06:10:12.320 night is not necessary the dark twah
06:10:15.080 flame is not needed anymore the faith
06:10:17.478 begins to call what was the original
06:10:19.920 state the Corrupted State we see this
06:10:23.280 Paradox in our own world how can it be
06:10:25.840 true that the secret knowledge of
06:10:27.600 reproduction physical toil and
06:10:29.958 competition over resources is the new
06:10:32.600 and unoriginal state for Adam and Eve
06:10:35.440 isn't it much more likely that Eden's
06:10:37.600 Utopia is the childlike view or the
06:10:40.840 ignorant view of someone raised in the
06:10:43.040 near Perfection of developed Society
06:10:45.760 shocked by the knowledge of the true
06:10:47.840 original state to the Mind raised in
06:10:50.440 shelter truth is horrific and ignorance
06:10:53.520 is bliss this theme of fear and
06:10:56.160 ignorance is in stories and myth the
06:10:58.400 Chinese myth the White Snake involves a
06:11:01.000 married man who in brief eventually sees
06:11:03.680 his wife in the form of a Sur
06:11:05.920 the man is so shocked he dies on the
06:11:08.000 spot what might this myth be saying is
06:11:11.240 it that the greatest fear in developed
06:11:13.440 Society is that fundamentally even those
06:11:16.558 closest to us can be snake likee no
06:11:19.200 matter how well we know them the
06:11:21.520 infamous Medusa turns us to Stone but is
06:11:24.680 it her magic or our shock at seeing that
06:11:27.320 a once Pious woman could behave how she
06:11:30.000 did it is much more comforting to assume
06:11:32.798 that all humans are not competitive like
06:11:35.240 lustful and aggressive but Angelic and
06:11:38.040 touching the Divine just don't look too
06:11:41.558 close this willful ignorance is shown in
06:11:44.360 modern stories as well in Harry Potter
06:11:47.000 when asked by the students about the
06:11:48.478 Chamber of Secrets have a simple answer
06:11:51.440 it doesn't exist it does not exist it
06:11:55.558 cannot be a part of us and it cannot be
06:11:58.120 a part of the school the snake cannot be
06:12:00.958 so essential that it's in the very pipes
06:12:04.840 and so so ignorance grows this ignorance
06:12:07.920 combines with fear of the snake who is
06:12:10.360 to know which fears are grounded in
06:12:12.080 reality and which are fantasy maybe
06:12:14.600 snakes are poisoning the water supply
06:12:16.878 what if we can't trust our own food who
06:12:19.240 made the food after all in advanced
06:12:21.680 Society we don't know anymore by now we
06:12:24.760 probably want to keep it that way what
06:12:27.718 is this divin looking amu's Bush if I
06:12:31.600 tell
06:12:33.280 you I'm afraid you won't even
06:12:36.760 try and one fear that arises again and
06:12:40.000 again in developed Society is what if
06:12:42.638 our own leaders were snake-like or
06:12:46.120 reptiles this Taps into a profound worry
06:12:48.878 that has long existed once again myth
06:12:51.240 reveals it clearly in Norse mythology at
06:12:53.878 the top of the tree of life is not a
06:12:55.958 reptile or a snake but a goat a goat is
06:13:00.160 simple-minded milk giving and under our
06:13:02.920 control it may eat some of the leaves
06:13:05.280 but we have domesticated it we may
06:13:07.840 choose to be led by goats because they
06:13:09.840 are safe they will not take advantage of
06:13:11.958 their position by stealing our
06:13:13.718 contributions and if they do they will
06:13:15.878 not do so very effectively but what if a
06:13:18.718 snake was leading us without our
06:13:20.360 knowledge what if the highest leaders of
06:13:22.520 church and state were snakes in Disguise
06:13:25.958 just imagine the disgust when those you
06:13:27.878 believe to be the lowest of the low the
06:13:30.000 most animal of all actually had slipped
06:13:32.600 through and crawled up from the depths
06:13:34.638 into position of power even worse is the
06:13:38.120 thought that what was once goat-like May
06:13:40.320 transform leadership brings power and
06:13:43.718 Temptation after all Reichard was a
06:13:46.240 noble a prer and yet seeing the paganism
06:13:49.840 he was tasked to Stamp Out started him
06:13:52.478 on his Blasphemous path was he corrupted
06:13:55.638 or did he see some of the reality that
06:13:57.878 drives the wheels of mankind Miyazaki
06:14:01.160 himself has said that many ideas for
06:14:02.878 villains have come from meeting the
06:14:04.320 leaders of large companies now I'm
06:14:07.080 president he says I get to meet a lot of
06:14:09.360 other company presidents they're such
06:14:11.558 weird people I'm fascinated by them with
06:14:14.600 a smile he adds I use some of them as
06:14:17.160 enemy characters in our games the
06:14:19.760 obsessive fear of the snake continues to
06:14:21.840 grow among all Society members
06:14:24.798 eventually anything connected to the
06:14:26.638 snake must be gotten rid of extreme
06:14:29.000 emotions sex and violence are one thing
06:14:31.760 but now even the Deep snake will be
06:14:33.798 tampered with if Society wants to reach
06:14:36.320 the Divine that means it must overcome
06:14:38.478 crude and vulgar methods of birth and
06:14:41.080 death this society says we will take
06:14:43.680 control of how we reproduce we will
06:14:46.240 interfere with the timing the method and
06:14:49.760 the cycle old methods will be beast-like
06:14:52.400 when compared to these now Society will
06:14:56.240 dictate death and where the dead are
06:14:58.400 taken where they are buried and the
06:15:00.400 meaning given to their souls departure
06:15:03.320 and so it moves higher birthing death
06:15:07.160 competition all is controlled those who
06:15:10.638 rise up are slain those who reproduce
06:15:13.600 outside the bounds of the rules are
06:15:15.240 punished snake Cycles are controlled
06:15:18.440 almost completely this control has been
06:15:21.240 taken in the time of America the spiral
06:15:24.080 the natural cycles of life is there in
06:15:26.360 the Elden ring of the Dragons it is
06:15:28.600 there in the time of The Crucible it is
06:15:30.718 plain to see in The Crucible symbols but
06:15:33.320 in the present the spiral
06:15:35.680 is gone the Society of the earth tree
06:15:38.638 has taken full control and it has
06:15:40.920 deleted what it found undesirable no
06:15:43.558 longer will life come from Death all
06:15:45.958 will be bright under the light of the
06:15:47.638 earth tree there will be no dark no true
06:15:50.680 death no pain no rot no disease and no
06:15:55.680 Rebellion but did ignorance play a part
06:15:58.320 in these decisions we climb higher to
06:16:01.040 flee the snake we want to touch the
06:16:03.320 Divine but as was true for every stage
06:16:06.040 of life before this one there is a
06:16:08.400 balance there is always poison and
06:16:11.240 Medicine the Society of the earth Tre
06:16:13.400 seeks to fix the volatile in alchemy
06:16:16.160 this is the snake nailed to the tree or
06:16:18.600 to the crucifix but is this a Fool's
06:16:21.638 errand in Genesis the snake is known as
06:16:24.718 the deceiver certainly to follow the
06:16:27.200 snake as a member of society is to be
06:16:29.400 deceived you will cause yourself harm
06:16:32.400 but perhaps the deception goes even
06:16:34.280 deeper Revelation says the snake is the
06:16:37.520 deceiver of the whole World perhaps the
06:16:40.680 greatest trick the snake ever pulled was
06:16:43.478 to get us to hate it too much because
06:16:47.240 however High the monkeys climb snakes
06:16:49.840 can also climb trees which leads us to
06:16:53.160 the bottom of the iceberg miyazaki's
06:16:57.080 Paradox myth is full of Heroes who bring
06:16:59.920 their own downfall orio's wife uicy died
06:17:03.680 of a snake bite after a long Quest he
06:17:06.160 was granted the right to retrieve her
06:17:07.718 from the underworld she would follow him
06:17:09.760 up to the world of The Mortals as he
06:17:11.478 left but he was warned he could not look
06:17:14.760 back or she would remain in the world of
06:17:16.680 the Dead Forever just before he finished
06:17:19.520 his climb to the surface he couldn't
06:17:21.558 help himself he looked back and his
06:17:24.400 hopes died as the human monkey climbs
06:17:27.878 the tree of society it cannot help but
06:17:30.280 look back at the snake take a closer
06:17:32.600 look at snake charming the snake isn't
06:17:35.280 really being Charmed at all it's just
06:17:37.798 afraid and the irony is that the ones
06:17:40.240 who are really Charmed are every human
06:17:42.680 who stands around
06:17:45.000 watching and this is why a snake can
06:17:47.440 never
06:17:48.840 die the higher we try to climb the more
06:17:51.798 we deny the snake's existence the more
06:17:53.958 it gains in hypnotic power sin turns to
06:17:57.360 Taboo which gives it more Fascination
06:18:00.200 like a Hydra as we cut heads off more
06:18:02.920 grow in their place there is a thrill in
06:18:05.638 what is
06:18:06.600 forbidden the feeling of pure risk I had
06:18:10.200 that in the K's
06:18:11.958 column but it's thrilling okay um
06:18:17.320 then we'll move that thrill of risk the
06:18:21.958 firan karma explains this taboos
06:18:24.798 transform into lasting Obsessions By
06:18:27.040 virtue of the fear that they Inspire and
06:18:29.638 these monks tasked with protecting the
06:18:31.760 Giant's flame fell into temptation now
06:18:34.840 now some are black monks who wear a hood
06:18:37.240 that says the seduction of a taboo is
06:18:39.878 never easily spurned once we look back
06:18:42.558 at the snake and look into its eyes we
06:18:44.798 are put into a trance
06:18:47.280 hypnotized as we stare transfixed the
06:18:50.320 snake seems to whisper Temptations in
06:18:52.360 our ear as it did to Eve as it did to
06:18:56.080 Reichard to try and fight the Temptation
06:18:58.798 is like slowly being constricted as
06:19:00.920 though you cannot breathe as though the
06:19:02.718 snake were coiling around your chest
06:19:05.120 your neck how can it be so impossible to
06:19:08.320 resist if denal of the snake was only
06:19:10.840 the Temptation Of The Forbidden wouldn't
06:19:12.798 it be much easier to manage the feeling
06:19:15.120 of not being able to breathe is the
06:19:16.920 feeling of losing something essential if
06:19:20.000 something is truly our call of course we
06:19:22.160 cannot kill it of course we cannot
06:19:24.120 destroy the snake because it is still
06:19:26.120 what drives our actions even in society
06:19:29.600 look at the imagery of Dark Souls and
06:19:31.638 those who actively maintain Society look
06:19:34.798 at the humanlike enemies in bloodborne
06:19:36.680 who are actually puppeteered by snakes
06:19:38.878 from the inside or batilda bagshot also
06:19:42.400 puppeted by a
06:19:44.280 snake or the Iron Maidens driven by
06:19:47.360 snakes on the inside and what about the
06:19:50.120 symbol of society itself the Earth tree
06:19:53.520 well within the offspring of this tree
06:19:55.558 is found something surprising beneath
06:19:57.958 some minor ER trees lives its tree
06:20:00.000 Spirit a spirit that rides just like a
06:20:03.280 snake and the name name of this boss in
06:20:05.440 the game data snake soul and there isn't
06:20:09.280 just one snake in the roots of the world
06:20:11.400 tree in the north epic the poetic Eder
06:20:14.360 we are told more serpents there are
06:20:16.798 beneath the ash than an unwise ape would
06:20:19.600 think these snakes consume the dead and
06:20:22.360 dying roots and so renew the tree and in
06:20:25.478 a tapestry found in an ancient North
06:20:27.400 Ship we can see snakes depicted in the
06:20:29.520 roots of the tree intertwining in
06:20:32.638 spirals let me just cut the damn thing
06:20:39.280 the snake is still essential it is just
06:20:41.558 hidden only an unwise ape would ignore
06:20:44.798 its hidden wisdom the serpent is the
06:20:47.520 Earthly essence of man of which he is
06:20:49.638 not conscious it is the mystery that
06:20:51.958 flows to him from the nourishing Earth
06:20:53.958 Mother in alchemy the serpent holds
06:20:56.478 secret or deep knowledge it is beyond
06:20:59.280 what is consciously knowable GMA sta
06:21:01.958 shows this it takes Faith to use because
06:21:05.080 to use the wisdom of the snake requires
06:21:07.600 Faith the snake as Instinct seems to
06:21:10.600 possess a peculiar wisdom of its own it
06:21:13.200 is the reason why the snake signifies
06:21:15.080 evil and darkness on the one hand and
06:21:17.638 wisdom on the other miyazaki's
06:21:20.878 paradx three Roots there are that three
06:21:23.440 ways run neath the as tree
06:21:26.240 yrail this is miyazaki's paradox the
06:21:29.638 roots of things are at odds with each
06:21:31.558 other it isn't meant to be easy Society
06:21:34.840 and instincts Duty and emotions they
06:21:38.080 struggle against each other because that
06:21:39.798 is what it means to live in the lands
06:21:41.520 between lren or our own world it is what
06:21:45.000 creates the whole damn thing if these
06:21:47.280 contradictions feel frustrating and
06:21:49.040 uncomfortable well they're not meant for
06:21:51.360 you we believe Mia zaki's message is
06:21:53.840 that if society and its usefulness was
06:21:55.958 the face of a clock then each of us are
06:21:58.160 the cogs it is only through pressure
06:22:00.840 that results are created the dark is
06:22:03.920 necessary for the light snakes are the
06:22:06.478 ones who pulled the sun across the sky
06:22:08.840 and who tried to swallow it and as part
06:22:11.840 of Mia zaki's Paradox is a conclusion a
06:22:14.878 message that is clear in all his games
06:22:17.680 to try and resist this truth will bring
06:22:20.760 tragedy there will be rot death and
06:22:23.638 destruction in the world and we
06:22:25.478 shouldn't try to escape these things but
06:22:27.638 work with them as the coil Shield
06:22:30.000 originally said how can you poison a
06:22:32.638 poisonous snake we need to accept that
06:22:35.400 we aren't that far from monkeys after
06:22:37.280 all and that's okay the evidence that
06:22:40.600 Miaki Martin and the team believe that
06:22:43.160 tampering with the snake causes problems
06:22:45.320 is all around us we know that the spiral
06:22:48.200 the cycles of the world have been sealed
06:22:50.280 away long ago and what do we find in the
06:22:52.920 world around us the roots of the great
06:22:55.320 tree are ridden with insects wormlike
06:22:58.558 creatures even lower than snakes have
06:23:00.920 taken the place of once healthy tree
06:23:03.160 Guardians they walk the land hunched and
06:23:06.200 vomiting the lands between are becoming
06:23:08.478 full of tarnished those who have lost
06:23:10.798 their color and vitality even wealthy
06:23:13.798 Nobles are old worn gray the unsalable
06:23:18.878 is returning but in terrible ways rot is
06:23:22.760 seeping in where it shouldn't be even
06:23:24.600 infecting the children of Lords the
06:23:27.120 snake Souls of the minor her trees are
06:23:29.080 becoming sick and
06:23:30.718 ulcerated the wild animals are blighted
06:23:34.040 those who respect the Cycles are
06:23:36.040 rebelling America has tried to seal away
06:23:38.600 the Glide Queen and her power but the
06:23:40.798 influence of her Apostles is growing
06:23:43.320 other Rebels are rising up other gods
06:23:45.718 worshiped and many colors being worn no
06:23:49.080 seal can work forever Boger puts it best
06:23:53.280 maybe something went tits with it maybe
06:23:55.840 it's been broke for a good long time
06:23:58.878 dominula is a perfect example of the
06:24:01.120 suffering caused by removing the spiral
06:24:03.718 The Majestic windmills were once
06:24:05.440 wellmaintained they ground the Harvest
06:24:07.840 that would feed the nearby Capital now
06:24:10.520 the windmills are tattered whatever
06:24:12.680 grain is left is rotten the villagers
06:24:15.520 have turned to the snake in desperation
06:24:18.080 they crave the renewing power of the
06:24:19.958 cycle of life and death they crave it so
06:24:22.638 much that they bite their own arms as a
06:24:24.400 form of attack strength from Death the
06:24:27.638 spiral of blood the dominula women are
06:24:30.958 doing more to Kickstart renewing spirals
06:24:33.958 they are Infamous for hunting their own
06:24:35.958 men skinning and burning them but why
06:24:39.920 the answer is found in the festival look
06:24:42.600 at the virgins who play a special role
06:24:44.600 in the celebration they are hardly young
06:24:47.080 enough to still be maidens the hood they
06:24:49.798 wear is described as a stunning blue
06:24:52.638 that is only permitted for young Maids
06:24:54.798 who play a central role in the festival
06:24:57.280 but the blue is far from stunning the
06:25:00.000 blue is even faded compared to the Navy
06:25:02.280 hood that lies nearby worn by the the
06:25:04.440 corpse of a noble long dead these
06:25:06.958 maidens are far from the prime of life
06:25:09.760 isn't that bizarre why are such old
06:25:12.120 women maidens and dancing in the hopes
06:25:14.600 of losing their virginity well the
06:25:17.080 spiral has been removed all the aspects
06:25:19.798 of the snakes have been robbed of their
06:25:21.638 power including lust the original
06:25:25.120 turtleneck meat description says Turtle
06:25:27.798 meat is said to boost feril but none in
06:25:30.200 the lands between seem to have much
06:25:31.920 appetite for it these days in the lands
06:25:34.360 between the urge to reproduce has waned
06:25:37.000 long ago the men of the village no
06:25:39.440 longer feel physical desire but it seems
06:25:42.200 that the women still want them and want
06:25:44.798 children dominula villagers still dance
06:25:47.600 with hope at their ceremony they are
06:25:49.718 desperate for the men to regain their
06:25:51.600 potency so they can do the deed and this
06:25:55.478 is why they are skinning their men just
06:25:57.600 like a snake sheds its skin to be
06:25:59.440 renewed bright and full of Vitality the
06:26:02.320 women skin their men hoping that this
06:26:04.638 ritual will give them back their snake
06:26:06.718 power the liido not only do they skin
06:26:10.000 them they burn them like metal in a
06:26:12.080 forge to forge them a new and this may
06:26:15.600 not be totally insane the men once
06:26:18.280 coward begging not to be skinned but as
06:26:21.320 we walk by the burning pile of bodies
06:26:24.120 the men stand up
06:26:26.840 reborn all this pain simply because they
06:26:29.878 have been denied what nature granted
06:26:31.840 them they cry not unlike the and virgins
06:26:35.240 who cry as they hold a longed for child
06:26:38.520 the world in general is transforming for
06:26:40.798 the worse without death the system is
06:26:43.840 becoming
06:26:44.920 weak I feel thin sort of stretched
06:26:50.638 like butter scraped over too much
06:26:54.400 bread and as the competitive snake knows
06:26:57.878 weakness is vulnerability weakness means
06:27:02.040 opportunity if the Earth tree refuses to
06:27:04.400 burn in the fires of Rejuvenation a
06:27:07.000 competitor will crush it and competitors
06:27:10.080 are rising the supposed one God of
06:27:12.958 America cannot hold its place the many
06:27:15.920 gods are coming um and thus created the
06:27:19.200 seven where most of the peasants say
06:27:21.638 okay we have seven gods no no you have
06:27:23.600 one God New Kings the god of scarlet rot
06:27:27.840 who is growing their presence in the
06:27:29.320 lands between they possess a wicked
06:27:31.638 intelligence and shouldn't be
06:27:33.040 underestimated
06:27:34.600 and the greatest threat of all is the
06:27:36.520 serpent rard growing endlessly beneath
06:27:39.680 the Mana a threat so grave that morgot
06:27:42.520 had to wage all out war against him and
06:27:45.440 morgot knows what he is doing it is
06:27:47.680 essential that rikard be stopped because
06:27:50.440 just as a demigod has a shadow that will
06:27:52.958 one day Shepherd them to the world of
06:27:54.680 the dead so too is everything given a
06:27:57.840 time to die and so the Society of the
06:28:01.120 earthree is no exception it too will end
06:28:05.360 as those destined to kill the Earth tree
06:28:07.160 begin to rise it will be called
06:28:08.878 blasphemy just like every Uprising in
06:28:11.280 the past just as America's early
06:28:13.440 resistance against the king of England
06:28:15.440 claimed to be chosen by God was called
06:28:18.478 Blasphemous but in the end everything
06:28:21.440 dies individuals cultures ages worlds
06:28:27.400 because it is inevitable death cannot be
06:28:30.240 sealed
06:28:31.878 forever but have you noticed something
06:28:34.478 throughout the whole playthrough of this
06:28:36.200 game have you noticed that there has
06:28:38.478 never not once been a true snake
06:28:42.718 Reichard has limbs the apostles have
06:28:45.638 assimilated snake biology but are not
06:28:47.920 full snakes snake men are not true
06:28:51.160 serpents snake statues have wings some
06:28:55.160 serpents are like snails as they make
06:28:57.200 shells their home no serpent is pure so
06:29:02.240 what is going on and how is this
06:29:04.680 connected to dragons true serpents
06:29:08.798 dragons shadows and much more all can be
06:29:12.718 found in the deep dark depths beneath
06:29:16.120 the
06:29:17.200 iceberg but it is not just the reptilian
06:29:20.160 appearance there is something else that
06:29:22.600 connects them the ancient dragons have a
06:29:25.360 full set of Limbs and on their backs
06:29:28.160 multiple pairs of wings but just like
06:29:30.798 the true serpent starts Without Limbs
06:29:33.520 and then seems to gain them so too can
06:29:36.400 the dragon seem to lose its limbs the
06:29:39.718 ancient dragon's weaker modern
06:29:41.520 counterparts have lost a pair of Limbs
06:29:44.120 and a pair of wings and this design
06:29:46.760 choice is very consistent across from
06:29:49.040 software games the snake and the dragon
06:29:51.920 are clearly connected in our world the
06:29:54.558 year of the snake is often called the
06:29:56.558 year of the little dragon in Greek myth
06:29:59.680 it can be a serpent or dragon that
06:30:01.840 guards the famous golden apples and the
06:30:04.638 most infamous of all snakes Satan
06:30:07.120 himself is just as ambiguous how could
06:30:10.040 the biblical serpent be punish to crawl
06:30:12.760 on the ground if he started with no
06:30:15.478 limbs well Satan was once called a
06:30:18.958 dragon in the Bible and at the same time
06:30:22.080 as lust Envy aggression is released onto
06:30:25.600 the world in Dark Souls there is also
06:30:28.680 this strange connection one imperfect
06:30:31.080 dragon is the Hellkite Drake it is
06:30:33.478 different from the Eternal dragons this
06:30:35.920 difference has been important to the
06:30:37.478 community for years what is an ancient
06:30:40.478 dragon a dragon and a drake the mystery
06:30:44.398 becomes even more confusing in the
06:30:46.200 silver serpent ring item description
06:30:48.558 which says the snake is an imperfect
06:30:51.040 Dragon if we combine the Eastern
06:30:53.360 reverence for dragons with Mia zaki's
06:30:55.798 snake SL Dragon ambiguity we can find
06:30:58.878 the answer a thread that links the two
06:31:02.600 like the Turning of the windmills and
06:31:05.200 the twisting of the
06:31:06.920 Whirlwind we can see the answer
06:31:10.280 everywhere and nowhere the Serpent's
06:31:13.760 amnon will never dry out the dragons are
06:31:18.320 Eternal a snake can never die the god
06:31:22.398 Shiva holds a trident showing the past
06:31:24.920 the present and the future and with them
06:31:28.000 is a snake both the snake and the dragon
06:31:31.638 are the
06:31:32.558 manifestation of
06:31:34.638 time the dragon is divine eternity and
06:31:38.478 the snake is Mortal eternity the dragon
06:31:42.080 is part of the Heavenly realm it is
06:31:44.440 truly Eternal but the snake is only
06:31:47.040 Eternal thanks to the Mortal tools of
06:31:49.478 survival it has to crawl on its belly
06:31:53.040 the serpent if it wants to become the
06:31:55.040 dragon must eat itself this is the
06:31:58.160 connection between dragons and snakes
06:32:00.718 and their difference the way they
06:32:02.600 survive through time
06:32:04.600 this is why when a dragon uses the
06:32:06.360 methods of a snake it is cast down into
06:32:08.958 the base mortal plane when ancient
06:32:11.920 dragons turn to birth Envy lust they
06:32:15.360 descend towards the snake gryal gives
06:32:18.638 birth to offspring and she has lost a
06:32:21.160 pair of wings her remaining pair have
06:32:23.520 fused with her front limbs she is no
06:32:26.040 longer a true ancient dragon modern
06:32:29.000 dragons her descendants have the same
06:32:31.320 traits they are weak in comparison
06:32:35.000 the envious and deceitful SE is
06:32:37.160 serpent-like and lacks the Eternal
06:32:39.638 scales the Hellkite Drake may be big but
06:32:42.878 it's on the Earthly plane it is not
06:32:45.520 Eternal for it has been born as it will
06:32:48.478 survive with Mortal methods it has less
06:32:51.080 Limbs and wings a defining part of the
06:32:54.320 Eternal dragons are their scales they
06:32:56.798 are Stone and unchanging to lose them is
06:33:00.320 to die but the snake scales must stretch
06:33:03.280 change and eventually shed the snake
06:33:06.798 must shed its scales over and over to
06:33:09.040 live forever the dragon serpent
06:33:11.320 relationship is beautifully illustrated
06:33:13.558 by their two greatest bosses the dragon
06:33:16.558 lord whes about himself like the coils
06:33:19.760 of endless time strikingly similar to
06:33:22.558 the position of the Great Serpent but
06:33:24.718 the mighty Dragon soes effortlessly
06:33:27.600 above the ground the dragon is of heaven
06:33:30.558 and can survive effortlessly but the
06:33:32.840 snake rests firmly on the earth amongst
06:33:35.760 disparity forced to warm itself to
06:33:38.558 survive in other stories we see the same
06:33:41.398 pattern SM hungers for Treasure and what
06:33:44.440 does tolken called this dragon that has
06:33:46.360 fallen into Vice there was a most
06:33:49.240 specially greedy strong and wicked worm
06:33:53.040 called smow fafner who murders for his
06:33:56.600 treasure eventually has his limbs
06:33:59.040 removed and Ying long a dragon from
06:34:01.760 Chinese mythology is punished by by the
06:34:03.958 gods for disobeying them the dragon's
06:34:06.360 punishment is to be cast down to the
06:34:08.440 Earth to lose its wings and to be forced
06:34:10.878 to live as a serpent the snake cannot
06:34:13.440 rest like the dragon of mineral stone
06:34:16.080 the snake must wind endlessly and yet as
06:34:19.240 it crawls you can see in it the shape of
06:34:23.040 Infinity but if dragons are one end of a
06:34:25.600 scale and they can fall it must mean
06:34:27.920 that snakes can move up the scale too
06:34:30.280 and become more Divine this is the
06:34:32.558 reason for the pseudo snakes we see in
06:34:34.878 game around the volcano Mana is a dream
06:34:38.000 for all to see winged serpents ricard's
06:34:42.718 fantasy this is why Reichard has limbs
06:34:46.120 it is his first stage towards becoming
06:34:48.680 Divine just as the pillars around him
06:34:50.958 have risen in spirals Reichard has risen
06:34:54.000 too his snake cult is no longer the
06:34:56.638 basest form of chaos it is on the way to
06:34:59.398 becoming a new Society his family is
06:35:02.360 large he has a Community the numbers of
06:35:05.280 snake men in the city are growing you
06:35:07.798 couldn't call it a civilization yet but
06:35:10.160 with time it will develop and his limbs
06:35:12.920 will grow But Wings are a human fantasy
06:35:17.680 the snake can only climb so far and the
06:35:20.478 human with the snake within him is
06:35:22.798 always of the Mortal plain you may have
06:35:25.680 noticed that every Mastery of the snake
06:35:27.718 we've mentioned was not a human
06:35:30.120 achievement menown snake goddesses grip
06:35:33.040 the snakes in both hands only Hercules
06:35:36.000 could kill the Hydra the snake that
06:35:37.920 could not be killed by Mortals he proved
06:35:40.638 he was the son of Zeus and deserve to be
06:35:42.920 back on Olympus Heaven is for the gods
06:35:45.958 and you must be divine to overcome
06:35:48.160 mortality humans are the snake not the
06:35:51.240 dragon in the Greek myth of esus esus
06:35:54.760 watches snakes to unlock the secret of
06:35:56.878 eternal life but Zeus watches him as he
06:35:59.600 makes his Discovery Zeus strikes a
06:36:02.000 sleepus down with lightning in
06:36:04.000 punishment dragons can descend or take
06:36:06.840 human form such as lancs the reverse
06:36:10.360 however is impossible but like dragons
06:36:13.798 themselves the idea of transcendence is
06:36:16.040 a Perpetual human fantasy we try and try
06:36:20.440 but it always ends in Failure these
06:36:23.320 tragic failures are everywhere in Elden
06:36:25.520 ring the clearest is the magma worms
06:36:28.398 they couldn't become Divine and so they
06:36:30.520 are punished to be forever reminded of
06:36:32.718 their snake likee mortality their scale
06:36:35.360 sword States it said these land bound
06:36:38.360 Dragons Were Once humans who partook in
06:36:40.840 Dragon communion a grave transgression
06:36:43.520 for which they were cursed to crawl the
06:36:45.520 Earth upon their bellies Shadows of
06:36:47.878 their former selves which leads us to
06:36:50.680 the secret of the Gods in Elden ring now
06:36:54.520 we realize The Serpent and the dragon
06:36:56.718 are the manifestation of Eternity
06:36:59.040 something else starts to become clear
06:37:01.760 there is a god-skin Noble in theur
06:37:03.520 Church of agay with the skin of Reichard
06:37:06.000 given in worship and in phula there is
06:37:09.320 the head of a dragon also given in
06:37:11.840 worship which a godkin noble and a
06:37:14.558 godkin apostle lurk beneath this is a
06:37:18.000 god both societies worship phula has
06:37:21.558 endlessly been crumbling and the dragon
06:37:24.000 lord who lives beyond time has been
06:37:27.200 deserted by his God the godkin Tells a
06:37:31.160 Story as though the god they worship
06:37:33.558 wears the faces of all other gods brings
06:37:36.920 them into existence and kills them the
06:37:40.478 wearing of faces is not new to Martin's
06:37:43.080 work the apostles are just like Martin's
06:37:46.200 Priests of black and white who serve the
06:37:48.878 god of death they call the god of death
06:37:51.718 the
06:37:57.620 [Music]
06:38:03.558 of this God Arya asks simple questions
06:38:06.798 after joining the black and white cult
06:38:09.080 such as who should die and who their God
06:38:11.760 Is The Answer could have been in Elden
06:38:14.120 ring it is not for you to say who shall
06:38:16.760 live and who shall die that gift belongs
06:38:19.798 to him of many faces we are but his
06:38:22.840 servants swords to do his will Arya
06:38:26.120 glanced at the statues that stood along
06:38:28.040 the walls candles glimmering around
06:38:30.440 their feet which God is he why why all
06:38:34.320 of them said the priest in black and
06:38:37.718 white but if the Glide Queen brings the
06:38:40.798 dusk the ending of life and Mar gave the
06:38:44.040 dawn the birth what God unites them who
06:38:48.240 is the god of many faces in Elden ring
06:38:51.760 the god worshiped in phula and volcano
06:38:55.080 Mana that has deserted placd saxs the
06:38:58.478 god of the Glide queen and the godkin
06:39:01.520 apostles is the god
06:39:04.040 of
06:39:05.000 time this God wears the faces of all
06:39:08.160 other gods dressing in the guise of all
06:39:10.798 events and all aspects of nature it is
06:39:14.240 camouflaged it brings things into
06:39:16.398 existence and can kill them all the gods
06:39:19.680 of nature scorpions and rot or antlers
06:39:22.920 and spirit all function within the god
06:39:25.760 of time one God with seven aspects and
06:39:29.478 here he their faces so they have seven
06:39:32.280 faces so there seven of no there's one
06:39:35.760 one placitas A's arena is an example of
06:39:38.958 what happens when this God departs
06:39:41.080 leaving its Lord in stasis time is
06:39:43.878 present across the spirit and the
06:39:45.798 physical worlds through it fate is
06:39:48.638 linked in lock step this God is of such
06:39:51.680 power that both snakes and dragons
06:39:53.958 worship it the glow mind Queen serves
06:39:56.718 this time God under whose watch every
06:39:59.120 beginning and every end occurs and
06:40:02.120 though the gods May resist the god of
06:40:04.320 time cannot be sealed away if it were
06:40:06.958 sealed it would be the ending of all
06:40:09.478 things for everything must pass within
06:40:12.840 time the message that time is the
06:40:15.558 ultimate God killer can be learned from
06:40:17.878 hug hug wants to forge a weapon that
06:40:20.718 could slay a god what could have the
06:40:23.478 power to kill a very God a
06:40:27.520 man cannot
06:40:30.520 kill a god
06:40:34.760 to make a weapon capable of such power
06:40:37.360 we need to imbue the weapon with the
06:40:39.160 power to twist time and because this god
06:40:43.120 holds the power of absolute ends and
06:40:45.520 absolute Beginnings it has the power to
06:40:47.760 end the cycles of mortal Realms A
06:40:50.760 Farewell to it all a peace a gift from
06:40:54.958 the god of
06:40:57.000 time death is not the worst thing it is
06:41:00.240 his gift to us an end to want and pain
06:41:04.120 when our sins and sufferings grow too
06:41:06.000 great to be born the Angel takes us by
06:41:08.440 the hand to lead us to the nightlands
06:41:11.040 where the Stars Burn ever
06:41:14.718 bright for Mortals Miyazaki says that
06:41:17.878 the plane we live on is where we belong
06:41:20.478 until the god of time takes us Paradise
06:41:23.760 is not for our kind we will always have
06:41:26.760 pains and passions Trading Places it is
06:41:30.240 the disparity of Life while it isn't
06:41:33.000 heav Heaven maybe we should embrace the
06:41:35.320 flame and the dark if we can't become
06:41:38.360 Divine ourselves we may make things
06:41:40.718 together that reach that realm greater
06:41:43.440 than the sum of our parts like a great
06:41:46.440 golden tree so peer forward with your
06:41:50.398 head held high there's something about
06:41:53.080 this Mortal realm after all
06:42:00.710 [Applause]
06:42:06.360 when fear was chased from her birthplace
06:42:09.120 a place where deathbed companions were
06:42:11.200 considered sacred and beckoned to the
06:42:13.398 lands between where she is instead seen
06:42:15.840 as vulgar as a foul and rotten witch she
06:42:19.478 was met by a renowned Knight who gave
06:42:21.920 her Solace and
06:42:26.320 support though we never hear him speak
06:42:28.760 or even meet him in the flashh we should
06:42:30.958 not assume he was of no significance
06:42:33.638 after all until we become fear's
06:42:35.878 greatest champion he is in all
06:42:37.958 likelihood fear's most trusted Confidant
06:42:40.638 in bringing about a new age a new order
06:42:44.160 of death
06:42:46.120 restored he was a chivalrous and
06:42:48.878 dauntless night widely known even before
06:42:51.638 fear's arrival as Lionel the
06:42:54.920 lionhearted there are few hints as to
06:42:57.478 his background though he stands out with
06:42:59.718 his distinctive and stylish attire whose
06:43:02.558 design is is reminiscent of the infamous
06:43:04.840 Katerina knights from The Souls games
06:43:07.120 with a rounded shape to deflect blows
06:43:09.280 more easily one of the heaviest and most
06:43:12.200 effective armor sets in the game Lio was
06:43:14.600 sure to be a knight respected across the
06:43:16.718 realm for his masterful skill in combat
06:43:20.160 he wields a great epe suggesting he was
06:43:22.680 a man of Honor preferring Jewels over
06:43:25.478 other less chivalrous forms of violence
06:43:28.520 this is pushed further By His one-of
06:43:30.440 a-kind Banner worn as a cape who design
06:43:33.558 features three epe or Rapier style
06:43:36.600 weapons similar to The Three
06:43:39.080 Musketeers could there have been two
06:43:41.280 other Knights that lonel once fought
06:43:43.320 alongside or perhaps it is a more recent
06:43:46.398 development pertaining to the sun and
06:43:49.080 the eclipse the protective
06:43:52.320 star Lionel on meeting FIA declared
06:43:55.798 himself to be her father and thus that
06:43:58.680 FIA was to be his own daughter under his
06:44:01.600 wing she was finally safe in the lands
06:44:04.080 between if someone had a problem with
06:44:06.200 her they'd have to go through him lion
06:44:08.760 all the lionhearted placing him as the
06:44:11.760 first of fear's new
06:44:13.600 champions in an earlier patch of Elden
06:44:15.958 rank lono's armor used to say he
06:44:18.398 declared himself to be the father though
06:44:21.478 this was surely changed for a reason the
06:44:23.680 old phrasing would have called into
06:44:25.478 question who exactly he would have been
06:44:27.718 the father of perhaps suggesting a
06:44:30.440 secret about
06:44:32.040 fear lonol was Brave honorable an
06:44:35.920 established Warrior and he also
06:44:38.200 possessed a degree of intelligence too
06:44:41.000 not only can he cast sorceries but he
06:44:43.680 also wields a carian Glenstone staff
06:44:46.718 hinting at ties to the carians in his
06:44:49.160 murky history this intelligence suggests
06:44:52.638 that he did not align with fear against
06:44:54.920 his will fear did not manipulate him or
06:44:58.280 tempt him he was smart seeing her for
06:45:01.040 what she truly was he knew of her
06:45:04.040 methods of her previous champions of her
06:45:07.160 intentions and he nonetheless accepted
06:45:09.920 her
06:45:11.520 fully like roer a character who hides
06:45:14.840 behind a facade of confidence and in
06:45:17.398 fact suffers from anger grief regret and
06:45:20.840 fear lonol found shelter and safety in
06:45:23.558 fear and her vision just as she found
06:45:26.398 safety in him before and he believed
06:45:29.320 that those who live in death deserve
06:45:31.920 this same safety
06:45:34.440 maybe it was through her that he saw the
06:45:36.280 true nature of those who live in death
06:45:38.958 or perhaps on his travels he had already
06:45:41.040 seen the floor in the golden order in
06:45:43.798 person perhaps lol himself was in need
06:45:47.000 of saving was he too afflicted by death
06:45:50.558 blight was his Advanced age starting to
06:45:53.478 limit him hence his interest in
06:45:55.600 restoring death his armor is found in
06:45:58.600 lendelle next to another that wears the
06:46:01.040 deathbed dress which suggests he may
06:46:03.958 have passed some time ago likely with
06:46:06.440 fear as His companion trying to heal
06:46:09.958 him however lonol can be summoned for
06:46:12.920 the Festival of War even if fear has
06:46:16.040 passed so he is likely not dead at least
06:46:20.320 not
06:46:22.718 truly it is important to note here that
06:46:25.520 fear does not require the death of her
06:46:27.600 Champions to use their spirit and this
06:46:30.440 is key When approaching fear's quest
06:46:32.320 line and law as a whole something we
06:46:34.478 will look at in a future video but for
06:46:37.478 now to illustrate this is the boss fight
06:46:39.920 fears Champions a fight which features
06:46:42.638 some nameless Champions as well as
06:46:44.760 Lionel and of course roer roer being a
06:46:48.360 tarnished sorcerer that can be met in
06:46:50.280 storm fail and whose Quest ends with him
06:46:52.840 suffering and passing away from Death
06:46:55.040 blight for which fear serves as his
06:46:57.440 deathbed companion laying with him
06:46:59.638 multiple
06:47:00.958 times however it is Poss possible to
06:47:03.360 reach fear's Champions without ever
06:47:05.360 starting roer's quest line without ever
06:47:08.040 meeting him in fact you can reach the
06:47:10.718 boss defeat it and then return to storm
06:47:13.520 Vil and start his quest like normal he
06:47:16.440 therefore is already in League with fear
06:47:19.120 before we meet him while this could be a
06:47:22.040 design oversight we think this indicates
06:47:24.398 how fear's Powers truly work and this
06:47:27.080 aligns with our own experience after all
06:47:30.120 fear does not kill us or require our our
06:47:33.120 death to take some of our warmth she
06:47:36.160 simply hugs us that is enough in taking
06:47:41.080 some of our warmth we ourselves can
06:47:43.280 appear as one of fear's Champions in
06:47:45.478 another's world if they are playing
06:47:47.958 online furthermore fear's Champions are
06:47:51.040 blue in color color being indicative of
06:47:53.920 the powers at play in Elden ring blue
06:47:56.798 symbolizes the soul the spirit and
06:47:59.920 ironically despite Godwin's associations
06:48:03.080 those who live in death seem to live in
06:48:05.798 death through their Spirit not body more
06:48:09.360 like Rani than Godwin their Spirit lives
06:48:12.398 on reanimating the dead body look at how
06:48:15.718 skeletons rise again through the power
06:48:18.040 of
06:48:19.160 spirit look how Untouchable Rani is or
06:48:23.000 how we can summon spirit ashes look how
06:48:26.360 those who live in death are abored for
06:48:28.520 choosing not to return to the Earth tree
06:48:31.120 where choice is also related to Spirit
06:48:34.760 the body is a fleeting thing but the
06:48:37.638 spirit the human in us all is what is
06:48:40.760 worth holding on to in fears and
06:48:44.040 Lionel's
06:48:47.638 Eyes under fear's Vision lonol Becomes
06:48:50.680 Her sword and strives to bring about
06:48:52.920 their new age of order an age which
06:48:55.760 cannot be fulfilled under the golden
06:48:57.920 order which actively hunts their kind in
06:49:01.440 fact at the start of our playr fear is
06:49:04.638 stuck circumstances have compelled my
06:49:07.798 stay at the roundt hold thanks to Darian
06:49:11.558 and she has lost Godwin's hallow brand
06:49:14.040 courtesy of Devon the golden order has
06:49:17.680 trapped her but fear has her Champions
06:49:22.120 while she remains at the round t hold
06:49:24.320 where she is safe she somehow manages
06:49:27.120 two Feats one is how she learns about
06:49:30.798 the black knife prints and even procures
06:49:33.440 a map to locate one second is that she
06:49:36.638 obtains the weathered dagger clearly
06:49:39.200 belonging to the D Twins and we believe
06:49:42.680 these are both managed thanks to her
06:49:44.920 most stalwart and dauntless Champion
06:49:48.638 Lionel the strongest amongst her
06:49:50.920 nameless Champions and her closest
06:49:53.200 relationship that we know of and when
06:49:55.958 fear talks about her findings she uses
06:49:58.718 language that implies a specific
06:50:01.120 individual someone who she cares for and
06:50:04.080 thus makes sure to keep their identity
06:50:06.240 safe from the player and unknown
06:50:09.080 tarnished in
06:50:10.958 truth I've heard tell from someone else
06:50:14.840 about the black knife prints that
06:50:16.718 Fascinate dear roer so lonol manages to
06:50:20.718 ascertain information regarding the
06:50:22.798 secret of the KN of black knives a key
06:50:25.840 in locating the missing Hall brand and
06:50:28.240 relays this information to her daughter
06:50:30.520 in the form of a map
06:50:33.200 could you please find the owner of this
06:50:35.798 dagger and return it to
06:50:38.440 them a certain person gave it to me as a
06:50:42.958 gift Lionel then manages to track down
06:50:46.040 the perpetrator of the theft of Godwin's
06:50:48.398 hallow brand Devon the beholder of death
06:50:52.440 however he no longer has the hall brand
06:50:54.718 on his person only the weapon with which
06:50:57.398 he cut Godwin and it is this which lonol
06:51:00.600 delivers to fear the weathered
06:51:06.160 dagger but this is where Lionel first
06:51:09.558 fails fear Devon's twin Darian refuses
06:51:13.718 to leave the round table hold except to
06:51:16.040 hunt fear thus he cannot be attacked
06:51:19.520 fear cannot use liol and instead turns
06:51:22.558 to us the new tarnished with her scheme
06:51:26.680 she uses the player to deliver the
06:51:28.680 Dagger marred by a black gash to Darian
06:51:32.040 and in so so doing succeeds in killing
06:51:34.360 her
06:51:39.878 captor fear is finally free primarily
06:51:43.600 thanks to Lionel's heroism and on
06:51:46.478 darian's death perhaps we see what
06:51:48.718 Lionel might be striving to become we
06:51:52.600 who humbly live in death live in
06:51:56.558 waiting to one day welcome our Lord what
06:52:01.240 right does anyone have
06:52:03.040 to object does he plan to become fia's
06:52:06.360 Lord the Lord of her new order after all
06:52:10.120 he is foremost amongst her Champions he
06:52:13.000 is fear's own father he has even been
06:52:15.798 taught fear's Mist who else could rise
06:52:18.760 to lordship but
06:52:20.600 him however the missing hrand must be
06:52:23.520 found before he can become Lord fear
06:52:26.878 after learning about the black knife
06:52:28.478 prins from Lionel and with subsequent
06:52:30.920 help from roer learned about Ron's role
06:52:34.000 in Godwin's death LEL is therefore
06:52:37.120 tasked to defeat Redan such that Ron's
06:52:40.638 fate is unlocked and might make herself
06:52:43.080 known again it is not to reach the
06:52:45.600 nameless city which fear makes her way
06:52:47.920 to with ease whether or not Redan is
06:52:51.360 defeated Lionel joins the Festival of
06:52:54.760 War
06:52:56.000 [Music]
06:53:06.398 and continues to protect his daughter by
06:53:08.718 covering his intentions he does not use
06:53:11.638 the prince of death's staff and instead
06:53:14.360 uses his older Kian
06:53:16.878 staff but no matter what he tries
06:53:20.120 defeating radar proves to be an
06:53:22.440 insurmountable task for
06:53:31.200 lonol the mightiest of the demigods is
06:53:34.320 after all no mere
06:53:36.718 Warrior Lionel's power for all his skill
06:53:40.200 and experience is found wanting in the
06:53:44.000 end he is no Lord at all and if lonol
06:53:47.638 was fear's only hope the vision of their
06:53:50.320 new age would end here before it ever
06:53:55.718 began however Fortune is on their side
06:53:59.440 for one whose power may be fit for a
06:54:01.718 lord joins the
06:54:04.280 festival lonel skills will not go to
06:54:07.160 waste joining our side in battle he
06:54:09.958 fights for those who live in death for a
06:54:12.520 new age and for his daughter together we
06:54:17.360 kill Redan in a battle that goes down in
06:54:22.958 history and succeed in releasing the
06:54:25.638 stars and Ron's fate however lonol is
06:54:29.840 not the champion who managed this feat
06:54:32.638 LEL realizes that he has been waiting
06:54:35.240 for a lord just as fear has and the
06:54:38.160 difference between fear's current
06:54:40.120 Champions and the Lord they await is
06:54:42.638 clearly represented in the fears
06:54:44.840 Champions boss fight everyone who
06:54:47.840 reaches this boss is shocked by the ease
06:54:50.360 of the challenge it feels anticlimactic
06:54:53.680 given the difficulty in reaching the
06:54:55.520 area especially when compared to the
06:54:58.040 challenge of beating forac straight
06:55:00.440 after in the culmination of fe's Quest
06:55:04.040 and we think this is deliberate from the
06:55:06.440 designers to illustrate that her
06:55:08.840 Champions are weak including her father
06:55:13.000 Lona our Lord will rise the lord of the
06:55:18.000 many and the
06:55:20.398 meek but this is not to say that lonol
06:55:23.440 didn't have value without him fear might
06:55:26.760 never have escaped the roundt hold
06:55:29.160 meeting an end that Devon illustrates
06:55:31.398 all to Happy
06:55:33.398 without him many players may have not
06:55:35.798 beaten Redan and without his support
06:55:39.478 fear his daughter may have never
06:55:42.718 fulfilled her
06:55:45.240 purpose the torch is passed to us and
06:55:48.958 fear tasks us with finding the missing
06:55:51.200 Hall brand and on rejoining the two Hall
06:55:54.920 Brands and one last fight against the
06:55:58.080 legendary fortox fear gives birth to The
06:56:01.680 Mending Rune of the death Prince whose
06:56:04.798 order Embraces death as equal to life
06:56:08.478 where those who live in death can find
06:56:10.920 Solace just as fear found solace in
06:56:13.840 Lionel and that he rer and many others
06:56:17.638 in turn found in
06:56:19.760 fear while liel may not have managed
06:56:22.718 everything for fear this new age
06:56:25.080 couldn't have been realized without him
06:56:28.080 will Lionel find peace in his success
06:56:30.958 despite the passing of his his deathbed
06:56:33.120 companion his daughter we know he is
06:56:36.320 still around but will he continue to
06:56:38.600 live in this new age or will he soon
06:56:41.600 pass following fear having achieved
06:56:44.440 their
06:56:46.638 Vision there are few who will go on to
06:56:49.398 tell Lionel's tale that is the cost of
06:56:53.000 his choices and his loyalty to fear but
06:56:56.478 those who do will speak of his chivalry
06:56:59.760 of his sacrifice for his daughter they
06:57:02.440 will tout his bravery and commitment to
06:57:05.240 make a future he truly believed in
06:57:07.520 become a
06:57:09.080 reality they will remember him with
06:57:12.200 respect lonol the lionhearted may not
06:57:15.798 have become a Lord but his actions will
06:57:19.160 nonetheless Echo Through the Ages
06:57:22.830 [Music]
06:57:26.780 [Applause]
06:57:38.798 no one is that good when someone's that
06:57:41.718 good they're cheating they have to be
06:57:44.798 the ancestral followers are called
06:57:46.760 Master Hunters but accuracy like this is
06:57:49.798 beyond superhuman strength or Vision
06:57:53.360 this next level archery is beyond anyone
06:57:57.040 even lar Anderson the mystery of their
06:58:00.878 archery and the answer behind it reveals
06:58:03.840 a beautiful people and culture and opens
06:58:07.040 a window into some of the deepest
06:58:09.478 secrets of the magical world of Elden
06:58:12.240 ring because this Mastery is not
06:58:15.080 strength it is spirit and these horn
06:58:18.320 folk are much much more than what they
06:58:21.558 appear so big law spoilers
06:58:26.080 ahead when we first arrive in their area
06:58:29.558 we are limited by our first impressions
06:58:32.520 every area in Elden ring is challenging
06:58:35.478 so idling around and sightseeing be it
06:58:38.360 at the capital the academy or the
06:58:41.600 mountaintops is an enchanting idea but
06:58:44.760 it's not practical in reality and a trip
06:58:47.840 to visit the ancestral followers has the
06:58:50.080 same problems anyone visiting ends up
06:58:53.760 panicked running away from lightning
06:58:55.840 bubbles that cannot be harmed or dodging
06:58:58.478 the attacks of the huge horned residents
06:59:01.638 try as you might some will Club you to
06:59:04.280 death or knock you down with arrows that
06:59:06.638 hit even the most experienced Souls
06:59:09.878 player these are definitely not perfect
06:59:13.080 conditions for LW
06:59:14.638 sleuthing despite that we all enjoyed
06:59:17.398 these underground challenges at least
06:59:19.798 for the most part as well as the
06:59:22.160 profound beauty of the area and the boss
06:59:25.360 at its end many have discussed the ReUse
06:59:28.478 of bosses in the game but we felt and we
06:59:31.520 feel many agree that we were very happy
06:59:34.280 to see a second ancestor Spirit boss one
06:59:37.920 of our first impressions was their names
06:59:41.200 the ancestral followers The ancestral
06:59:44.558 Spirits we also noticed that they were
06:59:47.160 exceedingly strong and brwy and items
06:59:50.638 described them as such just in case we
06:59:53.320 needed to be told they were obviously
06:59:56.280 very spiritual between the use of their
06:59:58.600 magic the object of their faith and
07:00:01.200 their unique ances and chance before
07:00:04.200 they become aggressive it is quite
07:00:06.040 Pleasant to pretend to be one of them
07:00:08.040 sitting by a group as they stamp around
07:00:10.160 a minor her tree or beside a shaman
07:00:12.680 chanting a haunting Melody next was how
07:00:16.440 they looked their clothes all seem to be
07:00:18.920 made with the raw materials of nature
07:00:21.958 leather sandals fur animal pelts their
07:00:25.958 bodies are extremely tall and muscular
07:00:29.040 with long arms and small heads relative
07:00:31.760 to to their body The ancestral followers
07:00:34.600 ashes call them horned folk and we find
07:00:38.080 large horns upon their heads the final
07:00:41.160 first impression was of how in harmony
07:00:43.878 they are with nature they forage their
07:00:46.600 food from nature while animals crowd
07:00:49.280 around them unafraid what's more the
07:00:52.240 animals don't only go about their
07:00:54.040 business they often even follow the
07:00:56.080 foragers during their tasks their tools
07:00:59.360 and weapons seem to be made from plants
07:01:01.760 or or the corpses of beasts clubs made
07:01:04.638 from jawbones and bows made from horns
07:01:08.000 for example they are hunter gatherers
07:01:11.240 with a spiritual religion that seems to
07:01:13.520 unite their approach all of these first
07:01:16.478 impressions made a pattern a pattern
07:01:18.878 that seemed familiar these first
07:01:21.558 impressions what we observed the item
07:01:24.320 descriptions even their names were some
07:01:27.200 of the first entries in a note we
07:01:29.240 labeled the ancestral followers and we
07:01:32.200 put this in a file a file called
07:01:35.718 cultures before the her tree then we
07:01:38.718 moved along in the game and we started
07:01:40.958 thinking about some of the more apparent
07:01:43.280 Mysteries outer Gods the Earth tree
07:01:46.520 itself what on Earth is an Elden Beast
07:01:50.120 anyway but we may have moved on too soon
07:01:54.200 the ancestral followers and the ancestor
07:01:56.798 Spirits are much more subtle compared to
07:01:59.958 a lot of the game but they are essential
07:02:03.680 to the law this is because their culture
07:02:07.160 is in many ways removed from and even
07:02:10.920 opposite to the mainstream culture in
07:02:13.680 the lands between in this video we aim
07:02:16.878 to show that if we can understand their
07:02:19.000 culture it is a shortcut to the
07:02:21.200 fundamental rules of the world in Elden
07:02:23.600 ring if Elden Ring's deep law is a
07:02:26.718 distant ocean understanding the Earth
07:02:29.200 tree and the outer Gods is akin to walk
07:02:31.840 walking the great distance to the coast
07:02:34.398 where the ancestral followers provide a
07:02:36.760 river as we started to discern them we
07:02:39.958 seem to move much more easily towards
07:02:42.760 understanding with greater and greater
07:02:45.120 insights along the way both Journeys can
07:02:47.638 get to the same answers but the
07:02:49.798 ancestral followers might be a more
07:02:52.200 tranquil route so let's go down
07:02:57.878 stream before we start on this journey
07:03:00.680 we just want to clarify that when
07:03:02.440 looking at The Inspirations for the
07:03:04.240 ancestral we are trying to show how the
07:03:06.878 beauty of certain rituals and cultures
07:03:09.440 in the real world may have helped from
07:03:11.638 software create a unique and compelling
07:03:14.520 fictional world no other comparisons are
07:03:17.320 being made when we look at what may have
07:03:19.638 influenced the ancestral followers
07:03:21.398 culture it's also important to emphasize
07:03:24.280 that the video is not attempting to make
07:03:26.440 value comparisons between different
07:03:28.840 cultures or societies additionally any
07:03:32.240 observations made about the roles of
07:03:34.320 males and females in the ancestral
07:03:36.440 followers cultures or in Elden ring are
07:03:39.280 based only on what we believe is
07:03:41.798 depicted in the game and the intentions
07:03:44.398 of the game's designers we have tried
07:03:47.000 hard to be sensitive and respectful in
07:03:49.478 our research but we welcome any feedback
07:03:52.240 or comments if we have inadvertently
07:03:54.680 made any
07:03:58.558 errors The ancestral followers fell out
07:04:01.440 of mind until we stumbled upon them
07:04:03.920 again this time above ground but
07:04:07.360 nonetheless amidst more ancient ruins
07:04:10.638 they were yet again in a place that gave
07:04:12.558 a sense of the Ancients everywhere we
07:04:15.638 ended up finding them gave this ancient
07:04:18.638 atmosphere we even find one wandering
07:04:21.080 alone in the lake of rot in yet another
07:04:24.000 ancient Realm of the lands between this
07:04:27.240 all once again gave the sense of a
07:04:30.080 pattern a pattern of age so in our minds
07:04:34.840 the impression was becoming more fixed
07:04:37.398 they're an ancient Society from before
07:04:39.680 the Earth tree possible Inspirations
07:04:41.958 from The Real World came to mind peoples
07:04:44.840 from the world over who had a culture on
07:04:47.280 their native land before a new Society
07:04:49.718 arrived eventually bringing War until
07:04:53.000 the newcomers became the primary power
07:04:55.760 with a new belief system not only did
07:04:58.520 the sense of having to flee and keep
07:05:00.878 their distance from the earthree society
07:05:03.080 fit this impression but so did the
07:05:05.478 aspects of the ancestral followers
07:05:07.478 spiritual worship ancient tribes all
07:05:10.760 over the world hold deep reverence for
07:05:13.040 Antlers and the species that carry them
07:05:15.680 too many to list such societies were
07:05:18.878 generally established before the
07:05:20.520 intrusion of urban or literate societies
07:05:24.440 so here was another ancient Society
07:05:27.240 before the UR tree just like the
07:05:29.558 beastman the nox or the
07:05:32.520 dragons however we think we were wrong
07:05:36.840 forgive us we will be wrong again and
07:05:39.760 likely a fair number of times as we work
07:05:42.520 to resolve the mysteries of Elden ring
07:05:45.120 for this beautiful
07:05:47.080 Community but on our replay of Elden
07:05:50.040 ring combing through the game for
07:05:52.280 details and insights something struck us
07:05:55.120 that we had noticed but perhaps not
07:05:58.718 understood their horns what are horns
07:06:02.680 famous for in Elden ring the budding
07:06:05.120 horn is related to The Crucible from
07:06:07.520 before the her tree Omen horns are
07:06:10.320 evidence of something anti-er Tre and
07:06:13.040 also share similarities to The Crucible
07:06:15.398 and pre- Erry era beasts and dragons
07:06:19.120 have horns old things in general have
07:06:22.478 horns so horns are very important to
07:06:25.558 cross many areas but more than most the
07:06:28.600 ancestral followers obsess about horn
07:06:32.398 they worship a multi horned beast they
07:06:35.240 have huge horns sprouting from their
07:06:37.280 heads horns are used in many of their
07:06:39.878 weapons they carry out rituals and pray
07:06:42.958 for new buds upon these horns horns are
07:06:46.558 before the Earth tree and the ancestral
07:06:48.798 followers have horns so that's more
07:06:51.558 evidence there from before the earthree
07:06:55.040 right except the horns on their head can
07:06:58.520 be dropped now we knew this because we
07:07:01.798 picked up the item yet for some reason
07:07:04.680 we didn't think they wore the horns we
07:07:07.840 thought it was just adapted as a drop
07:07:10.120 for us as players to be able to wear the
07:07:13.200 horns but on analyzing their models
07:07:16.478 their horns can be removed just like us
07:07:21.240 so they do not grow them they wear them
07:07:24.920 which got us to look closer and begin
07:07:28.240 noticing more such as their name
07:07:32.878 ancestral followers this name feels so
07:07:37.160 ancient like the ancestral spirit this
07:07:40.680 majestic beast with so many sprouting
07:07:43.320 antlers and its ethereal
07:07:52.520 music yes this is a beast from the
07:07:55.160 ancient times and the accompanying
07:07:58.000 culture that worships it must be an
07:08:00.520 ancient one
07:08:02.000 except the word ancestral doesn't
07:08:04.520 necessarily mean ancient ancestral is
07:08:07.920 defined as of belonging to or inherited
07:08:11.638 from an ancestor or ancestors So in
07:08:15.638 theory something could produce Offspring
07:08:18.000 very quickly such as a rabbit and have
07:08:20.798 many offspring making a very distant
07:08:23.680 ancestor and yet still do this during a
07:08:26.558 relatively short lifetime the European
07:08:29.558 rabbit can bear Young At Six months old
07:08:32.600 and lives around 9 years so it could
07:08:35.680 meet its own great great add another 10
07:08:38.958 great and then some grandson or
07:08:42.160 granddaughter so it is the relation of
07:08:44.638 ancestry that is important not age
07:08:48.120 specifically and we know from Elden ring
07:08:50.600 that relations are much more flexible
07:08:53.240 than in our world there are many richly
07:08:56.280 nuanced relations that go well beyond
07:08:58.958 just blood the first impression of the
07:09:01.920 word ancestral continues to unravel if
07:09:04.840 we dig
07:09:06.280 deeper such as when we find a Shan
07:09:10.000 standing guard and what are they
07:09:12.920 guarding not an ancestral Spirit body
07:09:16.558 but a chest something which stands out
07:09:20.478 amidst all their natural ways guarding a
07:09:24.240 chest containing a material possession
07:09:26.878 in itself is already out of place from
07:09:29.840 the rest of their culture that f focuses
07:09:31.878 on nature fromsoft has always focused on
07:09:35.360 themes of greed and possession so for
07:09:38.240 the ancestral followers to possess a
07:09:40.320 chest feels almost Taboo in a culture
07:09:44.000 which clearly lacks a firm system of
07:09:46.280 ownership be it property or land they
07:09:49.320 have one chest hidden at the land's Edge
07:09:53.798 Beyond an archway in a secluded room
07:09:58.040 guarded by a Sharman so what is in the
07:10:01.718 chest that is so precious to them that
07:10:04.120 warrants holding it away in secret an
07:10:07.958 ancestral infants head skull of a very
07:10:12.120 young ancestral Spirit just think how
07:10:15.280 many sproutings it might bear it is
07:10:18.200 Young new it has no sproutings or
07:10:22.398 perhaps two if you count the tips it
07:10:24.478 starts with and yet it is still called
07:10:27.600 an ancestral Spirit it is hoped that it
07:10:31.520 will bear many sproutings and yet it is
07:10:34.398 still called ancestral further
07:10:36.920 illustrating that the name ancestral is
07:10:39.440 more about relation than time becoming
07:10:42.478 or creating a Lynch pin a central node
07:10:46.440 upon which to attach other things in
07:10:49.240 relation so the name ancestral was yet
07:10:52.920 another misleading illusion the next
07:10:56.120 thing that got us thinking was something
07:10:57.920 that kept being repeated like an
07:11:00.040 obsession in the I
07:11:01.840 descriptions The ancestral are always
07:11:04.600 referenced as being away from the her
07:11:07.000 tre's influence they are always compared
07:11:10.200 to the earth tree The ancestral spirit
07:11:13.478 is a phenomenon beyond the perview of
07:11:16.120 the earth tree The ancestral followers
07:11:18.958 live a distance from the earth tree says
07:11:21.958 Shaman fur this language is almost as
07:11:25.120 though the Earth tree and its Society is
07:11:27.798 a vital part of the locations of their
07:11:30.320 settlements as though it was taken into
07:11:34.600 consideration so what if this deliberate
07:11:38.040 referencing is because they were
07:11:40.000 actually not so ancient and had in fact
07:11:43.440 left this modern society to return to
07:11:46.840 Nature much more recently after all MOG
07:11:51.120 and his planned Dynasty also lies deep
07:11:53.840 within the Earth surrounded by
07:11:55.760 structures from the distant past but his
07:11:58.398 dynasty is not ancient and so we believe
07:12:02.600 that the ancestral followers are closer
07:12:04.958 in age to moog's New Order than to the
07:12:07.680 ancient beastmen we then decided to
07:12:10.878 really dig into the evidence of the
07:12:13.320 timeline of the ancestral
07:12:16.000 followers the first daming piece of
07:12:18.398 evidence that undermines their ancient
07:12:20.718 past is
07:12:22.798 nothing
07:12:24.520 nothingness if they are so ancient there
07:12:27.320 should be some evidence in history of
07:12:29.520 their interactions that culture their
07:12:32.878 Wars or something instead we find
07:12:36.520 nothing about them in any weapons spells
07:12:39.558 or items that reference the era before
07:12:41.840 the Earth tree we find nothing in
07:12:43.920 anyone's dialogue referencing them as an
07:12:46.240 ancient people in history we find
07:12:48.840 nothing in any stories whether in game
07:12:52.000 in interviews in guide books you name it
07:12:55.680 Muriel the greatest history buff in the
07:12:58.040 lands between makes no mention of them
07:13:01.360 we find nothing on any sword monuments
07:13:04.398 this nothingness is a terrible
07:13:07.638 coincidence consider storm Vil the nox
07:13:11.360 or faram maula with all of these the
07:13:14.160 fact that they were preer Tre is
07:13:16.040 revealed eventually the pattern to this
07:13:19.320 discovery is random and unpredictable be
07:13:22.200 it through subtle references
07:13:24.080 environmental clues or even interviews
07:13:26.440 with the developers but somewhere at
07:13:29.200 some time something is like to show a
07:13:32.040 placement in the timeline and yet the
07:13:34.798 ancestral followers possess only one
07:13:37.398 item that references any sort of History
07:13:40.798 what is this item the spiral horn Shield
07:13:44.680 which says once given to a tarnished
07:13:47.280 Warrior who cultivated close ties to the
07:13:50.080 ancestral followers while this was no
07:13:52.878 doubt a beautiful connection and a
07:13:54.878 beautiful story becoming tarnished was
07:13:57.398 something that happened after the Earth
07:13:59.440 tree once again the ancestral followers
07:14:02.160 are referenced in relation to the Earth
07:14:04.398 tree beyond that the history of the
07:14:07.040 ancestral followers is blank but what
07:14:10.718 about their neighboring cultures they
07:14:12.958 are close to ancient dynasties and yet
07:14:15.718 there is no evidence of any interactions
07:14:19.240 no Waring with them no indications they
07:14:22.000 shared culture no alliances no intrigues
07:14:26.160 or
07:14:27.040 conspiracies nothing another piece of
07:14:30.160 evidence is the the language used in the
07:14:32.398 item descriptions and anything else that
07:14:35.120 describes their culture this seems
07:14:37.840 almost deliberate on the part of from
07:14:40.320 software first let's look at some items
07:14:43.000 from other cultures for
07:14:45.398 comparison the dragon lord whose seats
07:14:48.000 lies at the heart of the storm Beyond
07:14:50.000 time is said to have been Elden Lord in
07:14:52.680 the age before the her
07:14:54.798 tree two great rivers flow beneath the
07:14:58.080 lands between the shifra and the Ang
07:15:01.878 the vast region is sent to be the grave
07:15:04.200 of civilizations that flourished before
07:15:06.638 the
07:15:07.878 earthree in the time where there was no
07:15:10.398 her tree death was burned in ghost flame
07:15:13.840 death birds were the keepers of that
07:15:16.360 fire the Warped remains of priests who
07:15:19.520 searched for Revelation in service of
07:15:22.120 the ancient
07:15:23.638 Dynasty these are just a few examples
07:15:27.320 the pattern continues for other cultures
07:15:30.120 whether it's the sence the people of
07:15:32.398 zamore or even the Onyx Lords the
07:15:35.558 language used does not try to hide the
07:15:38.280 facts
07:15:39.160 away now listen to these examples from
07:15:42.520 The ancestral followers ancestral
07:15:45.398 followers ashes a spirit of the horned
07:15:48.440 folk who asso letters and metal working
07:15:52.398 or from the Jawbone axe they distain
07:15:55.638 metal neither of these give us any time
07:15:58.840 information in other cases that ref
07:16:00.920 refence craft we can glean much more the
07:16:04.000 Beast man's Cleaver says it's clear the
07:16:06.558 beastmen possess knowledge Beyond human
07:16:09.280 can this can implicitly tell us a lot
07:16:12.798 but for the ancestral followers we get a
07:16:15.798 shoe really a shoe is defined as to
07:16:20.280 deliberately avoid using to abstain from
07:16:24.000 not didn't adopt or gave up not never
07:16:28.240 learned or turned away from no they
07:16:31.958 chose a shoe hunter gatherers could AO
07:16:35.920 technology as it came into existence but
07:16:39.040 so could we asue using computers today
07:16:42.958 and when it comes to the ancestral
07:16:44.680 followers this ambiguity is all we get
07:16:47.920 that or silence but is that just a
07:16:51.718 coincidence with fromsoft we think not
07:16:56.120 let us now look for horns other than the
07:16:58.478 headband what do we mean well it is
07:17:01.398 repeatedly mentioned that the ancestral
07:17:03.398 followers are obsessed about buds which
07:17:06.680 is unsurprisingly now somewhat ambiguous
07:17:10.638 does it mean animal horns or the buds of
07:17:14.120 plant life either way once their
07:17:16.558 headbands are removed we cannot see any
07:17:19.080 sprouting buds of any kind even if we
07:17:22.638 remove their garments in the game files
07:17:25.240 we see some impressive muscles but no
07:17:28.440 horns if they were an ancient people and
07:17:31.760 had been hoping and chanting for new
07:17:33.878 buds Through the Ages shouldn't they
07:17:36.160 have appeared by now even mogs Alban
07:17:39.200 have developed some and yet there are
07:17:42.600 none some can drop a budding horn but we
07:17:46.040 wonder if this is harvested from other
07:17:48.478 beasts just like the pelts they wear if
07:17:51.680 it is theirs it is still quite limited
07:17:54.040 compared to their hopes or what other
07:17:56.798 recent dynasties have achieved in fact
07:18:00.080 the language around this hope reflects
07:18:02.600 its future Obsession they are certain to
07:18:05.840 sprout from their very flesh they are
07:18:08.920 certain to implies a future event it
07:18:11.958 hasn't occurred yet indeed this language
07:18:14.920 sounds a lot like the language used for
07:18:17.958 the mwin dynasty glory to his inevitable
07:18:21.760 Reign the reigning Lord and hierarch of
07:18:24.878 the coming dynasty of mwin language
07:18:28.600 obsessed about a future of relatively
07:18:31.520 young
07:18:33.360 order with the horn headband removed
07:18:36.398 they are certainly not beast-like in
07:18:38.360 other ways they wear sandals to walk on
07:18:40.840 the ground showing their feet aren't
07:18:43.000 fully adapted to Nature they hunt with
07:18:45.680 bows and build Quivers and axes showing
07:18:49.280 they use tools in Elden ring it is
07:18:52.478 ambiguous what exactly constitutes
07:18:55.240 Humanity however in a colloquial sense
07:18:57.958 they are certainly human or humanlike
07:19:01.240 importantly they are never called demium
07:19:04.600 beast-like or less than human anywhere
07:19:07.520 in item descriptions or dialogue they
07:19:10.520 may be somewhat different to Human After
07:19:13.240 All Everything Changes in this world
07:19:15.398 relative to the Magics or Natures things
07:19:17.958 come into contact with just look at the
07:19:20.558 possible rot versions of the ancestral
07:19:22.920 that were cut or the sorcerers we find
07:19:25.718 who have turned in organic many of our
07:19:28.520 starting classes as a tarnished have
07:19:31.080 quite distinct takes on Humanity so we
07:19:34.760 can say that overall they are certainly
07:19:37.600 at least very close to Human After All
07:19:40.878 We would expect a significant change if
07:19:43.320 a group followed a totally different
07:19:45.200 lifestyle over many generations in the
07:19:47.558 lands between so we feel that they are
07:19:50.798 human anatomically even if there has
07:19:53.120 been some adaptation over time and that
07:19:56.240 this adaptation could easily have taken
07:19:58.840 place in a timeline that St Ed since the
07:20:02.040 Earth
07:20:04.680 tree another clue to their timeline is
07:20:07.600 where we find ancestral and evidence of
07:20:10.200 their culture in the lands between
07:20:12.718 remember the language that obsesses
07:20:14.638 about being at a distance from the earth
07:20:17.160 tree away from its influence beyond the
07:20:20.120 perview of the earth tree so let's think
07:20:23.240 about this approach if the ancestral
07:20:25.040 followers were truly ancient what
07:20:27.798 happens to those who possess an ancient
07:20:29.920 culture when when it is disturbed by
07:20:32.080 newcomers consistently across many
07:20:35.000 countries throughout history land is
07:20:37.920 taken to this day there are many land
07:20:40.680 disputes involving indigenous peoples
07:20:43.120 who in the past were forced to relocate
07:20:46.160 a more well-known example in history was
07:20:49.000 the Trail of Tears during which
07:20:52.200 thousands of Cherokee Mogi Creek seol
07:20:57.360 chiasa and chuor people were forcibly
07:21:00.638 removed from their homes this was in the
07:21:03.398 early 19th century and was sanctioned by
07:21:05.920 the US government who had passed the
07:21:07.718 Indian Removal Act this authorized the
07:21:10.840 forced relocation of Native American
07:21:13.360 tribes from their ancestral lands in the
07:21:15.600 southeastern United States to Indian
07:21:18.680 Territory of course if a people have
07:21:21.120 changed location there is usually some
07:21:23.638 evidence of their departure in history
07:21:26.000 and in the lands between we see this in
07:21:29.120 game in several places es from phula and
07:21:32.760 their beasts taking to the skies with
07:21:35.200 remnants of the culture still grounded
07:21:37.840 or the KNX banished from the surface to
07:21:40.200 deep below yet the evidence of culture
07:21:43.200 lives on up above whether deserted or
07:21:46.840 taken over we can always find evidence
07:21:49.638 of what came before if the ancestral
07:21:52.478 followers had been part of an ancient
07:21:54.718 culture and only avoided the Earth tree
07:21:57.040 after it became the center of the
07:21:59.000 dominant culture in the lands between
07:22:01.360 then there should be locations from
07:22:03.398 which they were forced out what we mean
07:22:05.798 to say is if for some reason the people
07:22:08.600 or philosophy of the urry society means
07:22:11.398 that the ancestral need to keep a
07:22:13.120 distance from them then wouldn't there
07:22:14.920 have been some ancestral that needed to
07:22:17.360 move from an old home and if they were
07:22:20.638 originally part of the urry society as
07:22:23.520 ancestral followers and chose to
07:22:25.878 distance themselves from it then there
07:22:28.200 would be evidence of their movement but
07:22:30.878 in the lands between we find no evidence
07:22:33.718 of their
07:22:34.638 relocation nothing that correlates with
07:22:36.958 the ancestral followers culture is found
07:22:39.520 in places that they are not we only find
07:22:42.520 evidence of the ancestral followers in
07:22:44.600 the places where they live now we do not
07:22:47.558 find any evidence of the replacement of
07:22:50.040 rule as in storm Vil or of departure as
07:22:54.240 with
07:22:55.160 beastmen what if we look at what we can
07:22:57.718 find and examine the sense of ancient in
07:23:01.200 them one of the first things that makes
07:23:03.920 us feel their Antiquity are the pillars
07:23:06.520 we light to access the ancestral Spirits
07:23:09.878 we believe these pillars date back to
07:23:11.718 the ancient past and are part of an
07:23:14.280 ancient Dynasty which existed well
07:23:16.638 before the Earth tree these pillars as
07:23:19.558 well as the iconic statues often found
07:23:22.160 with the ancestral give the followers a
07:23:24.558 general impression of age by association
07:23:27.840 but in fact that is all it is
07:23:31.558 Association or rather adoption these
07:23:35.638 columns are not of their making they
07:23:38.638 have taken these columns from older
07:23:41.360 societies why we will look into their
07:23:43.798 belief system in a moment and show how
07:23:46.000 many of their beliefs may align with the
07:23:48.240 belief systems of older cultures but
07:23:51.040 first of all let's take a look at the
07:23:52.798 evidence for when we find these pillars
07:23:56.440 in many places in the lands between but
07:23:59.080 these places are connected with
07:24:00.680 societies we know to be older than the
07:24:02.920 earth tree there is one notable
07:24:05.240 exception where we find Mog but MOG has
07:24:08.558 also used ancient artifacts for his new
07:24:11.360 Dynasty a dynasty that departs from the
07:24:14.398 earth tree so the physical pillars used
07:24:17.478 by MOG are also exceedingly old and all
07:24:21.440 these ancient pillars are fairly similar
07:24:24.160 they have the same markings drawings and
07:24:27.520 runes they have the same proportions are
07:24:30.840 roughly the same size and shape and are
07:24:33.878 made from similar
07:24:35.600 material however those of the ancestral
07:24:38.440 followers have two noticeable
07:24:41.000 differences at the bottom and top of
07:24:44.318 their pillars are two
07:24:47.240 alterations to allow us to light the
07:24:49.520 pillars and gain access to the ancestral
07:24:52.040 Spirit we light a basin at the foot of
07:24:54.398 the pillar and at the top is a
07:24:56.798 remarkable change there is a small well
07:25:00.558 carved into the Stone from which flame
07:25:04.120 can emerge there is no stone with the
07:25:07.160 carved well at the top of any other such
07:25:09.878 pillar throughout the lands between
07:25:12.120 other than by The ancestral followers as
07:25:15.120 well as it being altered it almost seems
07:25:17.920 that the stone is of a lighter newer
07:25:20.760 color on closer inspection the carved
07:25:23.798 basins have a pool of oil which explains
07:25:26.958 how they stay lit finally and something
07:25:30.080 that really pins down the ancestral as
07:25:32.798 after the creation of these pillars is
07:25:35.240 the fact that we know the ancestral
07:25:37.080 followers a shoe letters but what is on
07:25:41.280 the pillars that light up clearly with
07:25:44.718 magic
07:25:46.398 runes
07:25:48.000 letters if these people have never used
07:25:50.638 letters they could not build these
07:25:52.958 pillars but more importantly it would go
07:25:55.798 against their fundamental beliefs these
07:25:58.798 pillars are not their own and the ReUse
07:26:02.240 of the monuments of more ancient
07:26:04.398 cultures shows their true story the
07:26:07.798 story of a more recent return to the
07:26:10.520 Past not an ancient society's rejection
07:26:14.080 of the present so this is the timeline
07:26:17.600 of the ancestral followers as we see it
07:26:20.680 at least so far as their timeline isn't
07:26:24.160 over it's clear that they have a future
07:26:27.680 because their system seems to be working
07:26:32.000 who knows they may have a future that
07:26:34.160 involves more than keeping a distance
07:26:37.080 the weapon winged Great Horn says it is
07:26:40.478 made to reap the lives of beings which
07:26:43.200 experience no sprouting perhaps with
07:26:46.478 enough life and enough sprouting The
07:26:48.798 ancestral followers could be a force to
07:26:51.440 be reckoned with in time they might not
07:26:54.520 be so reclusive but instead a warlike
07:26:58.080 people striving to rid the lands between
07:27:00.878 of all distorting manipulations of
07:27:05.040 nature with their timeline established
07:27:07.718 we will take a deeper look at their
07:27:09.440 culture and gain a deeper understanding
07:27:12.040 of what the followers are all about now
07:27:15.040 that we know they departed from the
07:27:16.718 earth tree Society in their past it
07:27:19.160 makes sense that we find in the present
07:27:21.520 that distance from the earth tree is
07:27:23.398 still a vital importance we never find
07:27:26.398 them too close to the Earth tree and the
07:27:28.558 majority are even underground it seems
07:27:31.878 that the greater will and the urry
07:27:33.840 society fail to pierce underground as
07:27:36.440 effectively as they influence above the
07:27:39.080 sights of Grace themselves are not able
07:27:41.360 to draw Grace into them like they do on
07:27:43.600 the surface below ground is also where
07:27:46.798 other societies that have not aligned
07:27:49.080 themselves with leandel have managed to
07:27:51.798 sustain and below the Earth maybe more
07:27:55.280 than it seems in the lands
07:27:57.840 between the culture they nurture here
07:28:00.680 away from the danger of the golden order
07:28:02.958 Crusaders is deeply connected to Nature
07:28:06.520 itself they sustain their bodies from
07:28:09.360 nature hunting and Gathering their
07:28:12.398 clothes and tools are from nature their
07:28:15.440 worship is of a creature of nature they
07:28:18.798 have a faith in nature that nature is
07:28:21.398 abundant and will always provide so long
07:28:24.600 as it is treated with care and while
07:28:27.558 nature is balanced it is also d
07:28:30.080 dangerous and Powerful it must be
07:28:32.958 respected and part of that respect is
07:28:35.680 trust nature must be trusted despite its
07:28:38.958 afflictions to be the best system there
07:28:41.440 can be these hardships are necessary
07:28:44.958 even if the why is mysterious to believe
07:28:48.878 nature can be modified or outdone risks
07:28:52.478 invoking the wrath of Nature and may
07:28:56.120 corrupt or even defile the great
07:28:59.200 generator the universal mother of life
07:29:03.478 itself this respect in nature runs
07:29:06.160 through everything they do not only do
07:29:08.680 they take what nature furnishes when
07:29:10.798 foraging or hunting but they do not
07:29:13.318 waste anything they use many parts of
07:29:16.318 the carcass they dress themselves with
07:29:18.798 pelts they arm themselves with horns and
07:29:22.080 attach teeth to their arrows and the
07:29:25.160 animals they hunt are unafraid of them
07:29:27.958 which means they do not hunt Reckless
07:29:30.318 LLY they chant to all the nature around
07:29:33.680 them not only for their own ancestor
07:29:36.200 Spirit the mirror of these Traditions
07:29:38.760 rooted in nature is a rejection of
07:29:41.398 techniques that go against nature we are
07:29:44.398 told by The ancestral follower ashes
07:29:46.878 that they have rejected certain crafts
07:29:49.318 that are essential to other societies in
07:29:51.798 the lands between specifically letters
07:29:55.478 and metal working on the surface letters
07:29:59.000 and metal working sounds similar to
07:30:01.240 crafts in our own world both are of
07:30:04.080 great importance to the function of
07:30:06.240 society but in the lands between these
07:30:09.240 carry much more significance let us
07:30:12.478 first address metal working metals have
07:30:15.160 some important roles in the lands
07:30:16.958 between gold first of all has a
07:30:19.680 remarkable quality and metal working
07:30:22.360 with gold allowed Micha to stop the
07:30:25.000 progress of rot in his sister
07:30:27.798 Melania copper can Channel the will
07:30:30.760 allowing swords to fly in deadly arcs by
07:30:34.040 thought alone but if we have to choose
07:30:36.958 one example of metal working to
07:30:39.000 illustrate what the ancestral followers
07:30:40.920 are giving up it would be silver because
07:30:45.160 how do we birth ourselves in new with a
07:30:47.760 laral tear the core of a silver tear
07:30:51.840 silver or what we might call Quicksilver
07:30:54.958 is very linked to rebirth in the lands
07:30:57.680 between the renewing of the Soul in
07:31:00.318 another body while this may happen
07:31:02.760 naturally as colors and elements in the
07:31:05.440 lands between are of course naturally
07:31:07.638 occurring metal working is the
07:31:10.040 manipulation of these things it is the
07:31:13.000 imposing of your will onto the naturally
07:31:15.398 occurring Essences of nature so the
07:31:18.520 ancestral followers do not merely reject
07:31:20.840 metal working in the sense of our world
07:31:23.280 but they reject metal working in Elden
07:31:25.840 ring they reject control over rebirth
07:31:29.000 and life it is quite a power to ignore
07:31:32.600 and is just one illustration out of many
07:31:36.080 metals this demonstrates the unwavering
07:31:39.440 Faith The ancestral followers have in
07:31:41.638 their belief system the next craft the
07:31:44.638 ancestral followers reject is letters
07:31:48.440 once again in our society a rejection of
07:31:51.000 letters would still be very significant
07:31:53.760 it would mean a loss of a great part of
07:31:55.958 Education entertainment communication
07:31:59.280 and so on one to be a literate in the
07:32:01.680 modern world is extremely challenging
07:32:04.718 yet this significance in our world again
07:32:07.280 masks the even greater significance of
07:32:10.000 this craft in the lands between to
07:32:12.558 reject letters in the world of Elden
07:32:14.718 ring means even more to reject letters
07:32:18.478 means to reject the power of
07:32:22.040 runes one cut scene in particular can
07:32:25.000 clearly and elegantly demonstrate the
07:32:27.558 sheer power of runes
07:32:30.520 as we climb into a humble coffin beside
07:32:33.240 the waterfall in notron we surprisingly
07:32:36.718 start to rise and we can see the reason
07:32:40.760 letters runes appear in the air unlike
07:32:44.680 when they are bound up so deeply in
07:32:46.440 rings as to be invisible We rise up the
07:32:49.558 whole height of an enormous waterfall
07:32:52.520 reversing for a Time the encompassing
07:32:55.318 power of gravity runes are quite
07:32:58.558 literally a power to affect and
07:33:01.040 influence the laws of nature themselves
07:33:04.440 in this example it reverses gravity
07:33:07.398 runes can control the flow of these laws
07:33:10.360 and change it depending on your whim
07:33:13.398 once again we see the enormous devotion
07:33:15.840 of the ancestral followers to not make
07:33:18.120 use of this power and the Deep
07:33:20.478 commitment they therefore have to their
07:33:22.680 own beliefs both of these rejections
07:33:25.558 show that their belief and culture
07:33:27.878 revolve around a faith in nature
07:33:30.398 exactly how it is a trust that nature
07:33:33.920 will provide for them and through that a
07:33:37.200 profound humility they do not believe
07:33:40.200 they could improve nature and will not
07:33:42.840 attempt to change it this philosophy is
07:33:46.398 not only shown in these consequential
07:33:48.520 rejections but even in the smallest
07:33:50.680 details of their most simple crafts it
07:33:54.080 seems that they not only reject metal
07:33:56.160 working but any sort of sharpening they
07:33:59.240 use a blunt axe the Jawbone axe the
07:34:02.840 whole axe is furnished by Nature it is
07:34:05.958 meant to be that way so they reject the
07:34:09.240 possibility of sharpening an edge the
07:34:11.920 weapon foros a bladed Edge their arrowe
07:34:15.798 heads seem to be made from teeth which
07:34:17.840 are naturally sharp nature provides what
07:34:21.200 is needed if nature furnishes something
07:34:24.280 sharp it is meant to be used for its
07:34:26.760 sharpness if it furnishes something as
07:34:29.080 blunt then it is meant to be used as
07:34:31.440 such in the jawbones case as a
07:34:33.638 bludgeoning weapon they show in their
07:34:36.240 actions their belief that nature
07:34:38.318 provides what is required another set of
07:34:41.520 items that reveal their belief system
07:34:43.958 are their charms we have established
07:34:46.558 that colors and their Natures are
07:34:48.600 inherent across cultures in our color
07:34:51.200 video and how whether it is the
07:34:53.478 ancestral the urry faction or dragons
07:34:57.120 these colors maintain their nature what
07:34:59.958 is interesting is that amongst the
07:35:01.760 ancestral Charms only one is mentioned
07:35:04.760 as being precious to the followers this
07:35:07.718 is the mled horn charm in fact this
07:35:11.478 charm is the only horn charm given the
07:35:13.920 honor of being worn as a necklace so the
07:35:16.958 item is uniquely called the Mel necklace
07:35:20.920 this vividly colored necklace has many
07:35:23.440 colors and therefore many Natures it
07:35:26.958 shares Natures related to focus and
07:35:30.000 sleep immunity and poison robustness and
07:35:34.398 vitality the fire of life this sort of
07:35:38.558 varied colored item would not be so
07:35:41.000 welcome in her tree society and the only
07:35:43.798 people we find in lendal who wear many
07:35:46.360 colors are buried deep below the capital
07:35:50.600 this is a sign of the plurality of the
07:35:53.160 ancestral followers beliefs their
07:35:55.638 openness to all that is found in
07:35:58.040 existence if it occur occurs naturally
07:36:01.240 if it is natural trust it even if things
07:36:04.680 are in opposition to each other even if
07:36:07.200 they cause pain or loss even if they
07:36:14.680 compete unlike the belief in one true
07:36:18.120 God that is held as law by the earthree
07:36:20.718 society The ancestral are pluralist not
07:36:24.440 only do they worship the many competing
07:36:26.878 aspects of nature but they even allow
07:36:29.600 natural competition as part of their
07:36:31.718 very system after all we fight more than
07:36:34.840 one ancestral Spirit but only one is a
07:36:38.638 king we can guess that one may be upand
07:36:41.558 coming in spiritual power and yet they
07:36:44.318 do not deny the existence of this other
07:36:47.000 ancestral spirit and help its growth
07:36:50.360 they take this even further with the
07:36:52.478 Deep care and attention they give to new
07:36:55.638 potential ancestral Spirits chanting
07:36:58.840 young heads into new buds all life is
07:37:02.360 allowed and there can be more than one
07:37:04.638 vying for place the strongest will take
07:37:07.558 the crown this strength winds approach
07:37:10.680 as a belief is a much more ancient one
07:37:13.920 one the urry society has moved away from
07:37:17.718 here in the culture of the ancestral
07:37:19.920 followers they have returned to this
07:37:22.318 belief the true
07:37:25.240 king is the strongest
07:37:28.280 [Music]
07:37:31.798 now that we have laid the groundwork of
07:37:33.760 their culture let's have a look at their
07:37:35.798 broader place in art while the ancestral
07:37:38.920 followers culture design and history is
07:37:42.440 unique to Elden ring they seem to be
07:37:44.840 part of the wider shamanic archetype
07:37:48.080 whether in mythology real history or
07:37:51.440 Magic the Gathering From software has
07:37:53.878 placed the essence of the shamanic
07:37:55.878 archetype in the soul of this group this
07:37:59.080 AR type whose philosophy is found in
07:38:01.840 reality and frequently in mythology and
07:38:05.080 artistic Works usually presents
07:38:07.600 corresponding beliefs to the ones we
07:38:09.638 mentioned earlier faith in nature is the
07:38:12.600 greatest process faith in its abundance
07:38:15.520 despite its harshness and a respect to
07:38:18.520 not tamper with it because without these
07:38:21.440 processes all would perish this
07:38:24.520 archetype has many representations in
07:38:26.878 art whether as wood elves
07:38:30.600 fairies Druids or representations of
07:38:34.160 shamans in works that inspired Miaki
07:38:37.600 such as magic the Gathering and they all
07:38:40.520 are always absolutely minimal in the
07:38:43.200 damage they cause to their environment
07:38:45.760 their actions and their tools go with
07:38:48.760 the stream of Nature and one process at
07:38:52.520 the very core of nature is death all
07:38:56.520 shamanic belief systems respect and
07:38:59.440 value this part of life as a process it
07:39:02.798 is one rejected by the golden order and
07:39:05.920 as we become more familiar with the
07:39:07.840 ancestral we can see that the Life Death
07:39:10.520 cycle is Central to their beliefs how
07:39:14.000 essential life and death are as a part
07:39:16.398 of a complete whole is best shown from
07:39:19.080 The ancestral spirit's horn thus does
07:39:22.318 New Life grow from death and from Death
07:39:26.120 one obtains power this except of death
07:39:30.200 as a part of life is perhaps the most
07:39:33.000 important thing that defines the way of
07:39:35.558 life and belief system of the ancestral
07:39:38.718 followers they reject any attempts to
07:39:41.680 control life and death there is no
07:39:44.558 avoidance or Interruption of it it is
07:39:47.318 welcomed and embraced all of Nature's
07:39:50.558 systems are respected but this system
07:39:53.160 more than any other is sacred given that
07:39:56.958 natural death has been rejected from the
07:39:59.080 current parent order with the Rune of
07:40:00.958 death sealed this may also help with
07:40:03.638 their timeline their focus on the
07:40:06.080 importance of the Natural Life Death
07:40:08.200 cycle makes it likely that the ancestral
07:40:10.718 followers left mainstream Society after
07:40:13.718 the Rune of death was sealed this belief
07:40:16.920 can be found in everything what they
07:40:19.398 wear what they use even expressing
07:40:22.600 itself on their faces almost physically
07:40:25.558 embodying this obsession with life and
07:40:28.398 death not only do they not alter what
07:40:31.040 they take from nature but so much of
07:40:33.680 what they take is from Death they give
07:40:36.798 New Life to a corpse by using it as a
07:40:39.680 weapon from death comes power the teeth
07:40:43.638 made for their arrows are from Death the
07:40:46.680 jaw worn around the Shaman's neck is
07:40:49.318 from Death their colored charms are from
07:40:52.200 Death the horns that make their bow are
07:40:54.638 from Death from death comes power they
07:40:58.440 nourish themselves eles from death and
07:41:00.920 we can even see them foraging perhaps
07:41:03.240 for mushrooms an example of nature
07:41:05.760 turning death into energy the followers
07:41:09.000 trust that nature will give energy back
07:41:11.200 from Death in abundance and to look at
07:41:14.040 the ancestral followers they certainly
07:41:16.520 don't lack in abundance the majority of
07:41:19.878 item descriptions referring to the
07:41:21.878 ancestral followers mention death life
07:41:25.240 or the power from Death this is not only
07:41:28.840 passive or received from nature it is
07:41:32.000 active the description of the winged
07:41:34.478 Great Horn states it is made to reap the
07:41:37.680 lives of those who experienced nose
07:41:39.958 sprouting reap meaning cut or gather a
07:41:43.558 crop for Harvest once again a sense of
07:41:46.680 the power of life from death and what of
07:41:50.200 the remarkable objects of their faith
07:41:53.040 The ancestral Spirits How Deeply are
07:41:56.280 they connected to life from death before
07:41:59.718 even meeting these creatures we have to
07:42:01.840 follow a ritual of pillar lighting as we
07:42:05.200 move through the area we light a fire at
07:42:07.680 the base of pillars flame an energy that
07:42:11.040 almost seems alive Sprouts once we light
07:42:14.240 a basin filled with what looks like
07:42:16.878 bones a life from Death the pillars have
07:42:21.398 oil at the top of them and what is oil
07:42:24.558 but the perfect representation of energy
07:42:27.680 from death it is also no accident that
07:42:31.398 these monuments themselves are very like
07:42:34.120 a horn this symbolic power from Death
07:42:37.240 lights the tip not unlike a horn
07:42:39.920 sprouting with life and glowing once we
07:42:43.360 have lit the pillars we can go to meet
07:42:45.680 the ancestral Spirit itself not the
07:42:48.958 young one a Dead skull with the
07:42:51.040 potential of sprouting and power life
07:42:53.878 from death but a mature one but of
07:42:57.520 course we do not meet it at first
07:43:00.080 instead we meet its remains a Corpse
07:43:04.760 Death We Touch these remains around one
07:43:08.200 of which The ancestral followers sing
07:43:10.558 and worship in order to go and meet the
07:43:13.398 ancestral Spirit full of life we must
07:43:16.718 first touch death as we interact the
07:43:20.520 body gives off a spiritual energy and
07:43:23.318 the air glows with it we are transported
07:43:26.398 by its power but this is only the first
07:43:29.680 example of the magic of death in a truly
07:43:32.798 remarkable boss fight on entering the
07:43:35.760 ancestral spirit's domain we are
07:43:37.840 reminded of its name it is the ancestral
07:43:41.600 Spirit not the ancestral deer it seems
07:43:45.478 to be less physically alive and instead
07:43:49.120 spiritually
07:43:50.638 Alive walking into the room we see on
07:43:53.318 the floor around us life literally
07:43:55.600 sprouting from Death there are countless
07:43:58.520 sprouting fungi New Life born from plant
07:44:02.440 and animal remains the next feature of
07:44:05.638 the room that strikes us as embodying
07:44:08.200 the life and death cycle are the spirit
07:44:10.440 animals that roam whose power will come
07:44:13.160 into play during combat and then we
07:44:16.440 fight the ancestral Spirit itself unlike
07:44:20.600 the spirit creatures at its feet this
07:44:23.040 creature is much larger and more
07:44:25.600 powerful than its remains during the
07:44:28.280 intimacy of the fight we can see the
07:44:30.280 ancestral Spirit up close it is powerful
07:44:33.760 but its appearance is an appearance of
07:44:36.520 death it looks sceletal a much larger
07:44:40.318 version of the Dead remains used to get
07:44:43.160 here it even looks like it has been
07:44:45.398 gutted or dead long enough that lots of
07:44:48.280 what wasn't sceletal has rotted away its
07:44:51.478 chest cavity now Hollow and open in
07:44:55.240 attacking us it displays even more of
07:44:57.840 the power it draws from death and as the
07:45:00.920 drama of the battle continues the spirit
07:45:03.478 animals remain
07:45:05.520 uninterested but if we manage to bring
07:45:07.798 down the ancestral Spirit substantially
07:45:10.520 it then uses its power to draw the
07:45:13.120 surrounding Spirit Animals energy into
07:45:16.638 it the spirits fall
07:45:20.398 down dead and yet the power of these
07:45:24.280 Spirits does not die their energy enters
07:45:27.478 the ancestral spirit revitalizing it its
07:45:31.080 horns glow with power and its HP
07:45:34.280 recovers in development its horns would
07:45:37.160 have grown physically after drawing in
07:45:39.840 their life but this was cut for release
07:45:43.520 but this is not all life from death
07:45:46.080 comes again later in the fight the
07:45:48.680 ancestral Spirit can suddenly and
07:45:51.680 confusingly for the player seem to die
07:45:55.798 it cries out in pain
07:46:00.080 while its legs crumble beneath it and
07:46:02.760 falls to the floor violently it is a
07:46:06.718 death animation and yet in the end this
07:46:10.120 Spirit creature does not seem to need
07:46:12.160 this body it emerges from another spirit
07:46:15.040 animal in the boss room killing it and
07:46:17.878 bursting forth from its body its new
07:46:21.000 body manifests in front of us expanding
07:46:24.600 and growing in the air its limbs Sprout
07:46:27.920 out with a gruesome sound
07:46:33.600 effect there is power from death and yet
07:46:38.000 is the original Beast truly dead for
07:46:41.680 this power from the previous BEAST's
07:46:44.040 soul is not only its Vitality the actual
07:46:47.600 nature of the Beast is now within the
07:46:50.120 ancestral Spirit it attacks differently
07:46:53.520 depending on which Beast it has emerged
07:46:56.080 from and even more eerie even its cry
07:47:00.200 Alters to sound more like the Beast it
07:47:02.600 has become a part of
07:47:16.550 [Music]
07:47:32.080 all of this however peculiar and
07:47:34.638 mysterious its mechanics is the life and
07:47:38.040 death cycle life and power from Death
07:47:42.600 with the Regal ancestors remembrance we
07:47:45.200 can get the ancestral Spirits horn it
07:47:48.680 shows the same beautiful glowing and
07:47:51.280 sprouting that lit up the antlers of the
07:47:53.760 ancestral Spirit during the fight the
07:47:56.398 description says that a number of new
07:47:59.120 growths Bud from the antler-like horns
07:48:01.798 of the Fallen King each glowing with
07:48:04.478 light thus does New Life grow from death
07:48:08.280 and from Death one obtains power the
07:48:11.680 Horn of the ancestral Spirit the center
07:48:14.680 of their worship perfectly captures the
07:48:17.600 ancestral followers philosophy of life
07:48:20.240 from death and even clearer than the
07:48:23.160 description is its function when
07:48:26.000 equipped if we kill enemies it restores
07:48:30.080 our Focus
07:48:37.080 points parting from The ancestral spirit
07:48:40.240 and back into the wider world we find
07:48:43.000 one curious piece of evidence for the
07:48:45.360 life and death Obsession of the
07:48:48.280 ancestral a lone ancestral follower in
07:48:51.478 the lake of rot a vestage of a group of
07:48:54.600 ancestral followers who were at one
07:48:56.478 point planned to be rot worshippers
07:48:59.478 this group removed from the final game
07:49:02.200 demonstrates the flexibility of
07:49:04.200 appearance and Natures in the world
07:49:06.840 change your nature your order and your
07:49:09.638 appearance can change rapidly we can
07:49:12.200 also see this in content that did make
07:49:14.398 the final cut such as with the blood
07:49:16.718 Alban oric however more importantly the
07:49:20.120 rot ancestral show how Central life from
07:49:23.638 Death is to their beliefs as long as
07:49:26.520 this essential tenet is maintained
07:49:29.000 naturally other manifestations of
07:49:31.120 worship that include it are possible rot
07:49:34.718 is necessarily life from death and we
07:49:37.878 may see it even in the uncut boss room
07:49:40.760 as rot embodies power from Death in a
07:49:43.558 natural manner The ancestral followers
07:49:46.000 could easily Branch towards rot and
07:49:48.398 worship it so this is one of the two
07:49:52.040 pillars of the ancestral philosophy to
07:49:55.718 understand it we could explore the game
07:49:57.558 itself and nothing else however so much
07:50:00.638 of the DNA of Elden ring is a product of
07:50:03.600 many previous sources because a worship
07:50:06.520 of Life Death cycles and of antlers is
07:50:09.920 not unique to Elden ring there are a
07:50:12.600 wealth of Inspirations that the creators
07:50:14.760 of Elden ring have definitely drawn from
07:50:17.680 so in order to shine a brighter light on
07:50:20.080 the mysteries of the ancestral and to
07:50:22.680 help us explain the other core pillar of
07:50:25.080 their society their unique spiritual
07:50:28.000 Magic we will look at some of the
07:50:29.798 Inspirations We Believe were involved in
07:50:32.318 their
07:50:33.200 creation the first Inspirations are so
07:50:36.200 broad that it could be taken from many
07:50:38.600 of the players themselves and our
07:50:40.798 passion to maintain a healthy world
07:50:43.600 because as we ride across the lands
07:50:45.798 between we can often see pollution
07:50:49.638 whether it is worm faces poison swamps
07:50:53.240 or the fading of the land itself the
07:50:55.798 world is clearly not in good health and
07:50:58.600 and if it's the earthree society that is
07:51:00.920 primarily damaging the world that it's a
07:51:02.958 part of then departure may become a
07:51:05.958 necessary choice and the ancestral may
07:51:08.398 have left it to try to counter this
07:51:11.318 imbalance another likely reason they may
07:51:13.798 have left is freedom autonomy is a theme
07:51:18.040 across from software games everyone from
07:51:21.240 individuals to large groups to even
07:51:23.920 those in power all have to make
07:51:26.680 sacrifices from the toil Bok who
07:51:29.638 sacrifices his time and energy to Aid
07:51:31.878 his master to even the current ruler of
07:51:34.398 landelle Keeping Up Appearances to avoid
07:51:37.080 his Society rejecting him it seems
07:51:39.638 everyone must make sacrifices to uphold
07:51:42.318 the systems and beliefs of society and
07:51:45.878 this can in Elden ring just as in our
07:51:48.920 world become stifling it can feel that
07:51:52.600 it becomes so costly and perhaps more
07:51:55.520 costly as Society advances that it is no
07:51:58.558 no longer worthwhile it can feel that
07:52:01.160 this sacrifice has no payoff and all
07:52:04.920 turns to Ash and the sacrifices for
07:52:07.920 order in Elden ring are much more
07:52:10.200 consequential than in the real world so
07:52:13.120 too are the risks much greater to those
07:52:15.600 on the wrong side of what is accepted in
07:52:18.280 a society over the long history of
07:52:21.240 earthree society in lendal there must
07:52:23.798 have been many who wished to leave the
07:52:26.240 ancestral followers just carried it to
07:52:28.520 to
07:52:29.600 fruition another is the simple call of
07:52:32.558 nature we are sure everyone can relate
07:52:35.318 to a desire to escape the mundane and
07:52:38.080 return to the beauty of nature let alone
07:52:41.080 in the lands between the attraction to
07:52:43.798 Nature has been felt by members of
07:52:45.638 ordered Society for as long as Society
07:52:48.360 has existed many feel this today and
07:52:51.398 certainly the artists and designers at
07:52:53.840 from software must feel it too they are
07:52:56.958 far from the first to EXP Express this
07:52:59.200 appreciation and desire for nature in
07:53:01.840 the artwork they make some have gone
07:53:04.558 even further acting upon it in the real
07:53:07.120 world myth Legend and history are rich
07:53:10.478 with examples that must have influenced
07:53:12.558 from software in the creation of the
07:53:14.718 ancestral followers many come to mind
07:53:17.440 easily one of the first Inspirations to
07:53:19.920 do so are the Amish rather like our take
07:53:23.040 on the ancestral followers the Amish
07:53:25.200 haven't always been separate from
07:53:27.040 society originally from Switzerland and
07:53:29.798 from only the 16th century this is a
07:53:32.240 very well-known example of a people who
07:53:34.520 decided to turn away from modernity as
07:53:37.360 opposed to an ancient people who
07:53:39.440 maintain their Traditions alongside
07:53:41.600 modernization running parallel to them
07:53:44.520 they forgo many aspects of society as we
07:53:47.360 know but an important part of many Amish
07:53:50.200 groups is that it is vital to live in
07:53:52.878 harmony with nature to live a lifestyle
07:53:55.920 that is
07:53:57.360 self-sufficient the next story to jump
07:53:59.440 into our minds and others who we discuss
07:54:01.920 this with is another true one it is the
07:54:04.760 story of Christopher mandas a young man
07:54:08.440 with a desire to depart from a modern
07:54:10.680 American life that he felt was
07:54:13.240 inauthentic he sadly met with some harsh
07:54:16.200 conditions in the Alaskan Wilderness and
07:54:18.600 faced with relative inexperience in the
07:54:20.958 crafts required to survive he died this
07:54:24.798 was adapted into the popular book Into
07:54:27.280 the Wild which was adapted into a famous
07:54:30.000 film of the same name Christopher mandas
07:54:33.200 has since become known the world over as
07:54:35.958 part of a story about searching for
07:54:38.000 freedom and authenticity as well as a
07:54:40.840 cautionary tale about the danger of
07:54:43.120 entering nature
07:54:45.558 unprepared but what about truly ancient
07:54:48.558 cultures many of their myths beliefs and
07:54:51.840 rituals involve life and death which is
07:54:55.000 to be expected what is more surprising
07:54:57.680 is just how how often they focus on
07:55:00.638 antlers it seems to occur so naturally
07:55:03.600 that we found similarities to the
07:55:05.558 ancestral antler beliefs across history
07:55:08.600 and across the globe perhaps this is
07:55:11.558 because antlers do have something
07:55:13.718 magical in them antlers are a remarkably
07:55:17.160 unique and beautiful production of
07:55:23.718 nature this innate sense humans have of
07:55:26.840 this magic the Wonder they Inspire may
07:55:29.840 be why so many cultures independently
07:55:32.718 worship them one inspiration that can be
07:55:35.558 found across the globe is an archetype
07:55:38.120 we will call the horned God this is a
07:55:41.558 supernatural being that is depicted as
07:55:43.878 human or humanoid but with horns this
07:55:47.440 horned God often embodies the same
07:55:49.638 traits across cultures they are often
07:55:52.120 associated with the wildness of nature
07:55:54.920 they often represent most fittingly for
07:55:57.318 the ancestral follow followers Life
07:55:59.920 Death birth and their Cycles an aspect
07:56:03.600 connected to this is
07:56:05.520 fertility examples of these gods are of
07:56:08.398 course the Greek god pan who often has
07:56:11.200 goat-like features and clo Hooves nature
07:56:14.520 and fertility are some of his essential
07:56:18.600 associations another is the Celtic god
07:56:21.520 konos konos also had antlers and was
07:56:25.200 associated with the forest and wild
07:56:27.638 animals
07:56:28.958 Armon the ancient Egyptian God was
07:56:31.840 sometimes depicted with ram horns and
07:56:34.398 was associated with creation and
07:56:37.040 fertility it is interesting that there
07:56:39.360 is a universal worship across cultures
07:56:41.920 and mythology not just of antlers but
07:56:44.840 also of what the antlers and those who
07:56:47.240 have them represent it may not only be
07:56:50.440 the magical beauty of antlers that
07:56:52.318 causes this but how they behave antlers
07:56:55.878 grow and split much like individual
07:56:58.760 lineages spread and grow most deer shed
07:57:02.398 their antlers each year even the Great
07:57:05.120 Red Deer of Scotland grows its Mighty
07:57:07.798 Crown only in one year and will grow it
07:57:11.200 again the next these innate qualities
07:57:14.760 the form of growth and life cycle of
07:57:16.920 antlers seem to have taken the human
07:57:19.318 imagination to similar places across the
07:57:22.080 world a further recurrent myth and
07:57:25.000 Legend across cultures is one that we
07:57:27.318 will call the wild man this myth is of a
07:57:31.040 man who rejects society and departs into
07:57:34.280 nature once in nature he adapts and
07:57:37.520 becomes in tune with the natural world
07:57:40.240 in some myths he eventually develops
07:57:42.240 mystical powers and may be able to talk
07:57:44.798 to animals this basic structure of the
07:57:47.718 myth also repeats of course reflecting a
07:57:50.878 deep desire in people for departure into
07:57:53.558 nature held across time and culture and
07:57:57.160 this desire naturally translates to
07:57:59.600 story and thus it has many unique
07:58:02.478 examples in many cultures one
07:58:05.600 inspiration that's a Hawkshaw favorite
07:58:08.200 is a late 14th century shival Rick
07:58:11.080 romance sir G and the Green Knight one
07:58:14.760 of the most famous Arthurian Stories the
07:58:17.718 Green Knight in question is described as
07:58:19.878 having branches and leaves growing from
07:58:21.958 his head and body though the ancestral
07:58:24.398 followers have yet to experience the
07:58:26.318 sprouting of buds we can't help but
07:58:28.680 imagine that the Green Knight was
07:58:30.360 something that inspired Mia Zaki in this
07:58:33.200 Legend the Green Knight challenges King
07:58:35.478 Arthur's knights to a game in which he
07:58:37.840 allows them an attempt at cutting off
07:58:40.040 his head with an axe on the condition
07:58:42.798 that he can return the blow a year later
07:58:45.920 G takes up the challenge although he is
07:58:48.958 suspicious he does it to prevent risking
07:58:51.638 Arthur taking up the challenge gain puts
07:58:54.718 all his might into his blow and lops the
07:58:57.840 head head of the Green Knight clean off
07:59:00.558 the headless body then stands picks up
07:59:03.638 the head and says he will see going in
07:59:06.478 one year perhaps this connection between
07:59:09.958 humans and plant life informed the
07:59:12.200 creation of Elden Ring's world or at
07:59:15.080 least the role of
07:59:17.040 headlessness so in myth this concept of
07:59:20.000 the power of Life of life and death and
07:59:23.318 the force of nature coming through
07:59:25.240 humans in sprouts and horns begins to
07:59:28.478 take form even in the USA a more modern
07:59:32.398 country there has continually been
07:59:34.520 history involving a return to Nature
07:59:37.398 less than a human lifetime after the
07:59:39.638 country's creation developed under
07:59:42.040 totally new principles for a society
07:59:45.120 Henry thoro decided he would leave he
07:59:48.520 said farewell to this young Society for
07:59:51.398 a time at least to live in nature by
07:59:54.200 Walden Pond publishing the book Walden
07:59:57.318 some years l data which recounted his
07:59:59.840 experiences the desire to return to
08:00:02.160 Nature was shared by those who came
08:00:04.360 after him and his book only served to
08:00:06.798 inspire them just like spreading and
08:00:09.398 branching buds in more recent history
08:00:12.958 there have been two Return To Nature
08:00:15.160 movements that swept across the US in
08:00:17.840 the 20th century the first called new
08:00:21.520 agrarianism responded to the economic
08:00:23.798 hardship of the Great Depression
08:00:25.798 urbanization and corporations had failed
08:00:28.558 them so many returned to the older ways
08:00:30.878 of the countryside and a more
08:00:32.638 sustainable way of living later in the'
08:00:35.440 60s and' 70s the back to the land
08:00:38.440 movement was another large departure
08:00:40.600 from cities many saw it a natural
08:00:43.600 response to a society they viewed as
08:00:46.280 materialistic and that moved them away
08:00:48.520 from an authentic life both of these
08:00:51.240 movements held Walden as an important
08:00:53.920 source of inspiration which was also one
08:00:56.718 of the few books Christopher mandas took
08:00:59.318 with him on his journey to return to
08:01:02.958 Nature one of the greatest Inspirations
08:01:05.520 we have found is a myth that is found in
08:01:08.000 many countries and despite its
08:01:10.520 uniqueness it seems many cultures
08:01:13.200 invented this Legend independently the
08:01:15.958 legend of the Green Man its strongest
08:01:19.240 roots are in European folklore
08:01:21.680 specifically from Celtic and Germanic
08:01:24.398 tribes in this myth the green man was
08:01:27.200 associated with the cycle of life and
08:01:29.718 death growth and fertility once again
08:01:33.120 this matches well with the ancestral
08:01:35.000 followers but his story is even more
08:01:37.840 peculiarly similar the basic Legend is
08:01:40.840 that a man becomes disillusioned with
08:01:42.878 modern society and departs to live in
08:01:45.280 the forest over time he becomes more in
08:01:48.120 tune with nature hunting and foraging to
08:01:51.240 survive eventually he grows horns on his
08:01:54.240 head becoming a symbol of the wildness
08:01:57.080 and freedom he is found in nature
08:01:59.760 finally as he becomes more and more one
08:02:02.798 with the natural world leaves and Vines
08:02:05.638 grow from his skin and flesh we find the
08:02:08.798 Green Man depicted everywhere in artwork
08:02:12.360 and literature carvings and churches
08:02:15.638 represented as a powerful and mysterious
08:02:18.520 figure embodying the raw power of nature
08:02:21.920 his transformation has been associated
08:02:24.160 with the cyclical nature of Life Death
08:02:27.000 and rebirth
08:02:28.600 we can find the Green Man carved in
08:02:30.958 stone across Europe his features and
08:02:34.040 expressions made of leaves this is
08:02:36.680 especially interesting as a lot of the
08:02:38.878 beliefs implied in the legend of the
08:02:40.840 Green Man Are pagan yet these stones
08:02:43.520 that we find these medieval carvings
08:02:45.638 upon are Christian churches Christian
08:02:48.798 churches across Europe especially but
08:02:51.440 particularly common in churches in
08:02:53.718 England France and Spain from the 11th
08:02:56.520 century onwards they are mostly carved
08:02:59.120 in the form of foliate heads that
08:03:01.398 incorporate leaves flowers and other
08:03:04.080 plant elements many famous characters
08:03:06.840 and Creations have likely been inspired
08:03:09.200 by the Green Man such as tree beard and
08:03:12.080 the Ants in the work of JRR tolken there
08:03:16.478 are even many Inspirations for
08:03:18.360 worshiping an antler Stag and even
08:03:21.000 wearing their antlers the Kelts who
08:03:23.878 lived in Europe during the Iron Age
08:03:25.878 believed that the Stag was a sacred an
08:03:27.798 animal that represented fertility and
08:03:30.080 the renewal of Life they would wear
08:03:32.520 antler headbands during religious
08:03:34.478 ceremonies including the belain festival
08:03:37.600 to honor the Stag the Pueblo people of
08:03:40.920 North America have used antlers to
08:03:42.920 Fashion headdresses for hundreds of
08:03:45.160 years and in many cultures including
08:03:48.120 Native American cultures antlers are
08:03:50.398 seen as a symbol of virility and
08:03:52.878 masculine power this theme of veril is
08:03:56.160 continued in Norse mythology ology where
08:03:58.398 the God frer was connected with
08:04:00.478 fertility and the Regeneration of the
08:04:02.718 natural world often depicted holding
08:04:05.240 antlers which symbolized his connection
08:04:07.520 to the forest and the cycle of life and
08:04:10.520 death indeed even Beyond mythology the
08:04:13.600 association of fertility seems to
08:04:15.840 naturally be attached to deer and dlers
08:04:19.440 this idea is symbolized very often in
08:04:22.040 Japanese art the cycle of life and death
08:04:25.520 and the process of rebirth is paired
08:04:27.920 frequently with antlers they are often
08:04:31.080 and especially interesting for Elden
08:04:32.958 ring depicted in proximity to trees and
08:04:36.558 their branches as though this reflects
08:04:39.040 the similarity in their branching links
08:04:41.680 or perhaps the shedding that trees and
08:04:43.878 antlers carry out seasonally we see in
08:04:47.080 many paintings deer symbolically close
08:04:49.718 to or under trees the branches of the
08:04:52.760 trees can reflect the position of the
08:04:55.080 antlers often almost intertwined with
08:04:58.638 them however to access the spiritual
08:05:01.798 religion of the ancestral and their
08:05:04.200 spiritual magic we need to get into the
08:05:06.520 inspiration of their faith The ancestral
08:05:09.440 Spirit worshiping Faith what is really
08:05:12.478 being worshiped during the worship of
08:05:14.798 deer and of antlers our own world may
08:05:17.958 hold the answers yet again and a clue
08:05:20.680 may be found by looking at the purpose
08:05:23.360 or payoffs of matching real world
08:05:26.478 ceremonies what what exactly are their
08:05:29.000 practitioners carrying out there is a
08:05:32.000 naho ceremony called The Blessing way
08:05:35.080 this is a ceremony that is performed to
08:05:37.160 prepare and bless a woman during
08:05:39.600 pregnancy and to ensure the safe
08:05:41.520 delivery of the baby there is singing
08:05:44.280 chanting and often gathering in a circle
08:05:47.080 to emphasize the interconnectedness of
08:05:49.798 all things another ritual practiced by
08:05:53.120 Native American tribes some among them
08:05:55.718 being the Lota shy and arapo tribes is
08:05:59.920 the sun
08:06:01.600 dance at the center of the ritual is a
08:06:04.440 pole instead of ancestral remains but
08:06:07.040 there is still singing and chanting
08:06:09.120 around the center and the goal of the
08:06:11.040 dance is to connect with the spirits and
08:06:13.360 bring healing and renewal to the
08:06:15.760 community the Navajo and Pueblo tribes
08:06:19.240 performed the corn dance where they
08:06:21.240 stomp on the ground in a circle while
08:06:23.600 chanting and singing to the spirits of
08:06:25.920 the Corn the an ancestral followers
08:06:28.558 stomp new sproutings into the ancestral
08:06:31.240 Spirit which while a different form of
08:06:33.840 growth and harvest is still through
08:06:36.440 Spirit like the corn dance the Yoba
08:06:39.718 people of Nigeria perform the barter
08:06:42.120 dance this once again invokes spirits
08:06:45.280 and the dancers wear shoes with bells
08:06:47.760 and stomp on the ground in a rhythmic
08:06:49.840 pattern while drummers play music and
08:06:52.520 singers chant so it seems these rituals
08:06:55.958 are working to imbue people and plant
08:06:58.558 with energy simply through the spiritual
08:07:01.000 power of dancing and chanting also and
08:07:04.920 very importantly a pattern is developing
08:07:07.718 around spirit and a connection to Spirit
08:07:10.920 through these rituals what of spirit
08:07:14.040 connections and antlers in the real
08:07:16.240 world in fact in many cultures antlers
08:07:19.280 are seen as a conduit for Spiritual
08:07:21.798 energy antlers themselves connect to
08:07:25.160 Spirit in some Native American
08:07:27.520 ceremonies they are used to access the
08:07:29.958 power of spirits in the Lakota Sue
08:07:33.040 tradition the medicine man wears an
08:07:35.280 antler headdress during healing
08:07:37.600 ceremonies as a symbol of spiritual
08:07:40.558 power the Navajo tribe also uses antlers
08:07:44.040 in various animal ceremonies such as the
08:07:46.680 night chant and the mountain chant as a
08:07:49.240 way to connect the spirits in the
08:07:52.080 ojibway tradition antlers are used in
08:07:54.600 the Meda win Society a spiritual organ
08:07:57.478 ganization that is responsible for
08:07:59.280 passing on the teachings and traditions
08:08:01.760 of the tribe antlers are not just a
08:08:04.398 symbol of power fertility and life they
08:08:07.520 are seen as reaching up and connecting
08:08:10.280 with spirit and once again this Spirit
08:08:13.280 connection for Antlers is across
08:08:15.360 countries and mythologies the Sami
08:08:18.280 people who are indigenous to Northern
08:08:20.240 Europe have traditionally worn antlers
08:08:22.478 on their heads During certain rituals
08:08:24.638 and ceremonies they believe that the
08:08:26.718 antlers give them the power to
08:08:28.240 communicate with the spirits of the
08:08:30.160 forest one particular tribe that may be
08:08:32.920 the most likely to have inspired from
08:08:34.920 software is the Inu people of Japan the
08:08:38.160 Inu people of Japan were not a group who
08:08:40.558 left mainstream Society of Japan but
08:08:43.080 rather have tried to keep to their
08:08:45.000 Traditions alongside modernization with
08:08:48.280 Japan having a less diverse population
08:08:50.680 than some other countries and with the
08:08:52.798 Japanese government's historic approach
08:08:54.920 to smaller populations in Japan it has
08:08:57.398 has been a challenge for the Inu to say
08:08:59.398 the least to put this in perspective the
08:09:02.120 Inu were only officially recognized by
08:09:04.478 Japan as an indigenous people in June
08:09:08.080 2008 the Inu people have a deep
08:09:11.000 spiritual connection to Nature many of
08:09:13.718 their traditional beliefs involve
08:09:15.478 animism the belief that all living and
08:09:18.240 non-living things have a spirit or Soul
08:09:21.360 the Inu also venerate deer and even in
08:09:24.200 the modern day we can see the reverence
08:09:26.558 towards an antlers the Inu have also
08:09:29.600 traditionally worn antlers on their
08:09:31.478 heads during certain rituals they
08:09:34.000 believe that antlers have a spiritual
08:09:35.920 power and can help them communicate with
08:09:38.280 the gods more than that antlers had a
08:09:41.280 deflecting power too they can ward off
08:09:44.280 evil spirits and protect you from
08:09:46.638 spiritual harm and the treatment of the
08:09:49.680 Inu people may also be mirrored in the
08:09:52.398 ancestral followers not just their
08:09:54.878 practices where the Inu have suffered
08:09:57.318 from marginalization in Japan constantly
08:10:00.120 having their territories infringed upon
08:10:02.200 and so have become more and more
08:10:04.160 cautious in their dealings with the
08:10:06.040 prevailing Japanese Society over time so
08:10:09.280 too might the ancestral followers have
08:10:11.558 become more and more focused on staying
08:10:14.240 away from the purview of the earth tree
08:10:17.840 more and more we see antlers connecting
08:10:20.200 with Spirit even across the world
08:10:23.080 accessing Spirit communicating with
08:10:25.958 Spirit and the examp examples continue
08:10:28.440 to show it the Tlingit people of Alaska
08:10:31.398 would wear headbands during spiritual
08:10:33.558 ceremonies to enhance their spiritual
08:10:36.000 power the sue people of North America
08:10:38.638 believed that the antlers of the deer
08:10:40.240 had a special power to bring them closer
08:10:42.558 to the great spirit they would wear
08:10:44.638 antler headbands during religious
08:10:46.398 ceremonies to enhance their spiritual
08:10:48.718 connection the aeni people of Siberia
08:10:51.680 where antlers as part of shamanic
08:10:53.718 rituals they believe that the antlers
08:10:55.920 allow them to connect with Spirit the
08:10:58.680 Cheyenne people believe that the elk is
08:11:00.920 a messenger from the great spirit and
08:11:04.160 what about during the hunt certain
08:11:06.680 Native American tribes especially those
08:11:09.000 in the plains regions such as The cheyen
08:11:12.398 Kuman Crow Blackfoot and the Lota which
08:11:16.760 is the example we use here were known
08:11:19.280 for their expert use of the bow and
08:11:21.600 arrow and their spiritual connection to
08:11:24.040 the Buffalo they hunted they believe
08:11:26.638 that the buffalo were sacred animals and
08:11:28.760 that the hunt required a spiritual
08:11:30.840 connection and reverence for the Animal
08:11:33.760 Hunters would often perform rituals and
08:11:36.000 prayers before and after the hunt to
08:11:38.600 ensure success and to show gratitude to
08:11:41.160 the animal for giving its life to
08:11:43.000 sustain the tribe an idea that is taken
08:11:46.360 Beyond a sense of Faith or feeling in
08:11:48.878 the real world to a tangible magic in
08:11:51.600 the world of Elden ring the Inuit people
08:11:54.600 of the Arctic have used Caribou antlers
08:11:57.200 for thousands of years to once again
08:11:59.840 fashion headbands they also believe that
08:12:02.680 the antlers have spiritual powers and
08:12:04.878 that they can help them communicate with
08:12:06.798 the spirits of the forest and the
08:12:08.718 spirits of the animals that they hunt
08:12:11.240 this belief of a spiritual connection
08:12:13.680 and even permission between Hunter and
08:12:16.200 Quarry is a common one the Inu also
08:12:19.360 believe in a spiritual connection to the
08:12:21.318 animals they hunt that the animals have
08:12:23.718 souls even that the hunter needs to ask
08:12:26.200 for permission for from the animal's
08:12:27.878 spirit before hunting it Hunters would
08:12:30.680 use charms and amulets to help them
08:12:33.558 connect with the animal's spirit and to
08:12:35.840 ensure a successful hunt so with these
08:12:39.120 insights from Beyond the game in the
08:12:41.240 real world we can return to the
08:12:43.318 ancestral followers and see that their
08:12:45.478 rituals are likely centered around
08:12:47.958 tapping into spirit and with this
08:12:50.760 greater understanding we can unravel the
08:12:53.200 mystery of how the ancestral followers
08:12:55.718 almost never miss when using the
08:12:59.958 bow we have already established the
08:13:02.398 concept of the spirit connection The
08:13:04.160 ancestral followers have with what they
08:13:06.080 are hunting but that's a belief that
08:13:08.160 already frequently exists in our world
08:13:11.440 we have noticed that the arrow glows but
08:13:14.120 if we look closer we can see this glow
08:13:16.958 is in specific places at the point of
08:13:20.160 the arrow and up the shaft and at its
08:13:24.600 fletchings if we then look at the arrow
08:13:26.760 without without it being used and from
08:13:28.878 the picture in the item description we
08:13:31.200 can see that these glowing parts are the
08:13:33.280 parts made from animals specifically
08:13:36.520 what has been taken on the death of an
08:13:39.000 animal a sharp tooth seems to be the
08:13:41.600 point and fur runs from the feather
08:13:44.280 fletchings up and around the arrow the
08:13:47.520 name and indeed the description can help
08:13:50.160 us even more here dwelling Arrow an
08:13:53.680 arrow in which the spirits of small
08:13:56.398 animals are thought to dwell finally as
08:14:00.318 they draw the bow the arrow seems to
08:14:03.080 draw in spirit from its surroundings
08:14:06.398 Spirit energy that is absorbed into the
08:14:09.080 arrow the arrow seems to already be in
08:14:11.878 Flight Before release much more than the
08:14:14.638 ash of War Mighty shot achieves when we
08:14:17.160 attempt it ourselves it's as though the
08:14:19.680 arrow is already moving towards us in
08:14:22.878 essence this is how they are so good
08:14:26.600 they AR Archer playing by the rules of
08:14:29.240 tension air wind and eyesight they are
08:14:33.398 using the
08:14:34.958 power of
08:14:37.240 soul and only after coming to this
08:14:40.120 conclusion from the evidence did we find
08:14:42.318 the description of the ash of War
08:14:44.840 Enchanted shot archery skill that
08:14:48.200 enlivens the arrow with spiritual
08:14:50.638 Essence the resulting shot will fly
08:14:53.280 faster than regular shot and change its
08:14:55.760 trajectory to follow the target the
08:14:58.520 arrow is made to seek our soul to follow
08:15:01.760 it physical dodging is sluggish compared
08:15:05.200 to spiritual accuracy when a soul seeks
08:15:08.680 a soul The ancestral followers are
08:15:11.238 Master Hunters because they have a soul
08:15:13.680 connection with their Quarry they take
08:15:16.360 time to imbue their arrows with soul
08:15:19.040 power then when hunting us they tune in
08:15:22.360 to our soul imbue the soul of the arrow
08:15:25.238 with a seeking desire and and let Spirit
08:15:28.200 do the work the spirit arrow turns and
08:15:31.318 seeks us leaving a trail of spirit in
08:15:34.318 the air before disappearing with the
08:15:37.238 sole connection the arrow flies with its
08:15:39.920 own will which is very similar to many
08:15:43.080 Soul seeking Magics across Elden ring
08:15:45.878 and the souls games this experience is
08:15:49.160 compelling evidence of the spiritual
08:15:51.398 power of antlers and soul as we said
08:15:54.360 before it is not their strength it is
08:15:57.160 Spirit further shown by how the
08:15:59.600 enchanted shot retains its power over
08:16:02.478 distance unlike the mighty shot to begin
08:16:06.680 unraveling even deeper mysteries of
08:16:08.840 their spiritual magic we need to look at
08:16:11.160 the window to the soul in Elden ring the
08:16:14.398 eyes this is a very important part of
08:16:17.280 them we haven't yet mentioned the
08:16:19.440 ancestral followers eyes are bright blue
08:16:23.080 other than perhaps a slight Touch of
08:16:25.638 Green their eyes are overwhelmingly
08:16:28.360 bright blue this color as we have
08:16:30.958 established is strongly connected with
08:16:33.440 Spirit it is also linked to intelligence
08:16:36.680 and the mind this blue is very familiar
08:16:39.878 in game especially because of
08:16:42.638 sorcerers however while the ancestral
08:16:44.920 followers and Sorcerers both have access
08:16:47.478 to this spirit Power it is clear the
08:16:50.160 ancestral followers use different
08:16:52.238 techniques the description of the
08:16:54.280 ancestral follower ashes says that they
08:16:56.600 are first in distinctive spiritual Arts
08:17:00.318 but we don't need this description it is
08:17:03.080 plain as day that they use totally
08:17:05.238 different methods to access this power
08:17:08.120 Sorcerers in Elden ring study read and
08:17:11.680 think we can find them doing this in
08:17:13.958 game in various locations often in
08:17:17.360 Peculiar ones they celebrate audition
08:17:20.878 they use their intellect to pierce the
08:17:23.440 power of spirit their reasoning is
08:17:26.160 extremely conscious and they put it to
08:17:28.600 work during long sessions of lonely
08:17:31.718 rumination but this Consciousness runs
08:17:34.718 against the stream of the way things are
08:17:37.600 the natural order otherwise you wouldn't
08:17:40.238 need to engage it in this way there is a
08:17:43.160 desire to understand but ultimately to
08:17:46.718 manipulate to use the power of the mind
08:17:49.360 to create change and thus sorcery is
08:17:52.798 often seen associated with alteration
08:17:55.840 transgression and
08:17:58.238 exploitation selin may go to more
08:18:00.680 extreme lengths than what other
08:18:02.360 sorcerers are willing to do but she is
08:18:04.520 not counter to her culture we know many
08:18:07.478 Sorcerers have an unnaturally long life
08:18:10.680 many have altered their forms bnala uses
08:18:14.000 the Amber egg we know that they tap into
08:18:16.840 the power of stars that Redan holds back
08:18:19.878 their motions that the soul is used as a
08:18:23.000 vessel they have even changed their very
08:18:25.798 Souls into Primal glint stones and the
08:18:29.000 description shows that it is not only
08:18:31.120 selin who has done this and while this
08:18:34.000 is soul related it is interfering with
08:18:36.878 the natural order it is using the
08:18:39.520 intellect to achieve a perceived
08:18:41.440 improvement from the way things are this
08:18:44.360 is clearly incredibly different to the
08:18:46.958 principles held by the ancestral
08:18:49.000 followers they have humility when faced
08:18:51.878 with how things are they do not wish to
08:18:54.520 alter nature because they do not believe
08:18:56.958 they can outdo nature or have authority
08:19:00.200 over it the ancestral followers access
08:19:03.318 the power of spirit using a different
08:19:06.318 way they seem to be totally instinctive
08:19:09.798 in their spiritual practice to use a
08:19:12.398 dark Soul's example their sorcery is
08:19:15.080 more like aails than
08:19:17.798 Vinheim they are accessing Spirit more
08:19:20.718 through intuition through feeling
08:19:23.760 through a natural connection after all
08:19:26.718 in the lands between everyone is
08:19:29.000 connected to Spirit rather like their
08:19:31.398 connection with nature The ancestral
08:19:33.318 followers are simply refining and
08:19:35.680 deepening this connection they use this
08:19:38.398 connection alongside chanting and
08:19:40.638 rhythmic rituals to tap into the spirit
08:19:43.398 energy in a natural way they are more
08:19:45.920 like Sailors using the wind rather than
08:19:48.440 a propeller driven boat they are
08:19:51.040 expanding the banks of an existing River
08:19:53.638 or creating a channel for it to flow
08:19:56.200 instead of using a dam they don't merely
08:19:59.398 use the tools of their body voice and
08:20:01.840 souls they use the relics of corpses
08:20:04.478 that have a connection to Spirit they
08:20:06.958 wear horn charms and Horn headbands that
08:20:09.760 can Channel spirit Power these antlers
08:20:12.840 innately have these properties and so
08:20:15.638 are still in line with nature it is very
08:20:18.958 like a natural crystal focusing natural
08:20:21.878 light when compared to a lamp except in
08:20:24.920 the lands between it is horn horns that
08:20:27.200 achieve this spiritual focusing we can
08:20:30.000 see the ancestral followers harness
08:20:32.160 Spirit from the aura of blue during
08:20:34.440 their dances and rituals The ancestral
08:20:37.558 remains give off this same blue this
08:20:40.600 blue is in the miasma of spirit energy
08:20:43.200 cast by The ancestral infant's head and
08:20:47.160 of course Very present in the ancestral
08:20:50.040 Spirit boss fight it also lights up
08:20:52.878 their arrows the arrows that almost
08:20:55.160 never miss let's look at what exactly is
08:20:58.238 at play here and try to solve the
08:21:00.520 secrets of their Spirit
08:21:02.600 magic if we look carefully at their
08:21:05.200 rituals we can find more insights into
08:21:07.680 their spiritual art for example it seems
08:21:11.000 that it is only shamans that sing during
08:21:13.760 their rituals the normal ancestral
08:21:16.080 follower Warriors only stamp in Rhythm
08:21:19.200 similarly the Sharman has a different
08:21:21.600 headband one with many Peaks that also
08:21:25.000 glows with spiritual life light
08:21:27.600 interestingly the normal ancestral
08:21:29.798 Warrior headbands while only possessing
08:21:32.238 two points do glow when a ritual is
08:21:35.200 being carried out the normally dull
08:21:37.760 horns become bright blue as they stamp
08:21:40.958 and the shaman sings In fact there is a
08:21:44.080 further difference the shamans seem to
08:21:46.798 give out Spirit energy this energy Moves
08:21:50.478 In Waves as though filling the area yet
08:21:53.958 the normal ancestral Warriors though it
08:21:56.680 is more subtle gently draw Spirit energy
08:22:00.398 into them even after the shaman stops
08:22:03.200 singing the horns continue to Glow for
08:22:05.840 some time before fading again though we
08:22:08.798 see clearly that their active absorption
08:22:11.000 of spirit energy stops the moment the
08:22:13.280 shaman stops
08:22:15.238 singing this shows that it is more than
08:22:17.798 a simple acccess of energy like we might
08:22:20.478 think of electricity this Spirit energy
08:22:23.600 is connected to relations there is
08:22:26.760 another thing that is intensely
08:22:28.680 spiritual that we only find near the
08:22:31.280 ancestral followers the blue balls of
08:22:34.680 lightning they glow with the same color
08:22:37.398 as the ancestral eyes and they seem to
08:22:40.398 be
08:22:41.718 autonomous sentient these sparking
08:22:44.920 bubbles are almost definitely associated
08:22:47.680 with ancestral followers because the
08:22:50.000 only two locations we find them in are
08:22:52.798 also very clearly where we find
08:22:54.878 ancestral followers and interestingly
08:22:58.160 the Sparks do not seem to electrocute
08:23:00.160 the ancestral followers since they are
08:23:02.718 Spirit channeling one might say that
08:23:05.280 they are in tune that they are with the
08:23:07.878 current of the river they are not Zapped
08:23:10.520 because they are much more in balance
08:23:12.600 with the Sparks where the player is
08:23:15.200 clearly offsetting the Natural Balance
08:23:18.318 does this Spirit energy in the bubble
08:23:20.478 seek life as the spirit energy in the
08:23:23.000 arrows does once they give off their
08:23:25.760 power they disappear like torrent or
08:23:29.760 rany the next most important thing for
08:23:32.680 looking at their spiritual art is the
08:23:35.200 ancestral Spirit itself the focus of
08:23:38.238 their Faith remember the importance of
08:23:40.798 its name the ancestral Spirit remember
08:23:45.238 that during the fight it goes on to gain
08:23:47.600 extra power from other spirit animals
08:23:50.238 which are not of a physical form and in
08:23:53.478 the cut content its antlers would have
08:23:55.478 grown as it Drew Spirit into it perhaps
08:23:58.798 showing the process at work but very
08:24:01.798 importantly it seems that as well as
08:24:03.878 drawing up this Essence The ancestral
08:24:06.440 Spirit can distribute this Spirit energy
08:24:09.280 too it is all about relation and
08:24:12.520 distribution is one of these relations
08:24:15.398 just look at the remains which
08:24:16.840 constantly give off Spirit energy the
08:24:19.878 other word in its name is ancestral
08:24:22.318 which we have already established is
08:24:23.878 about relation not time can be ancestral
08:24:27.440 because others can join it in relation
08:24:30.280 the antlers are very like a family tree
08:24:33.280 so this beast and its antlers are not
08:24:35.878 only a divining Rod but a great system
08:24:38.798 of distribution withdrawal and
08:24:41.798 maintenance The ancestral followers Soul
08:24:44.478 Arts seem to be a channeling and a
08:24:46.958 focusing of the Natural Soul and souls
08:24:49.798 in all of nature the ancestral spirit is
08:24:52.878 a being whose antlers can act as a
08:24:54.920 divining rod and and can also enable the
08:24:57.798 holding of souls in relation through
08:25:00.958 sproutings it becomes an ancestor via
08:25:03.958 this relation if not literally in the
08:25:06.478 sense we hold in our world this push and
08:25:09.798 pull of spirit takes life gives it
08:25:13.440 renews it and brings power from Death we
08:25:17.600 see them Channel this Spirit into the
08:25:19.680 growth of horns of the king of their
08:25:21.718 society and also of plants in the north
08:25:25.878 we find find them carrying out their
08:25:27.520 ritual and much more than anywhere else
08:25:30.478 there are rhymed Crystal buds sprouting
08:25:32.878 up these buds are frozen by the cold but
08:25:36.120 it is life that emerged from The
08:25:37.920 ancestral followers channeling energy
08:25:40.718 the design of these buds shows it
08:25:42.760 growing from a dead Branch life from
08:25:46.200 Death with Spirit channeled through this
08:25:49.160 relation and while they have not grown
08:25:51.600 buds from their flesh yet the fur rment
08:25:54.080 says that they hope for new buds from
08:25:55.760 their flesh
08:25:56.920 and indeed their souls for perhaps the
08:26:00.798 most important thing is the spiritual
08:26:03.558 flourishing of their
08:26:07.440 society before we tackle the deepest law
08:26:10.238 that applies to the whole world of Elden
08:26:12.120 ring we have some Mysteries we need help
08:26:14.878 with why are some ancestral followers
08:26:17.920 spirits and some physical when they are
08:26:21.000 physical their blood is red but when
08:26:23.520 they are Spirit why is their blood white
08:26:26.718 could it imply the relation of their
08:26:28.718 spirits to time why is a red wolf of
08:26:31.558 rigan found down in their domain why did
08:26:35.318 they cut the rot version of The
08:26:36.840 ancestral followers if only to have one
08:26:39.318 roaming down in the rot Lake did they
08:26:42.238 not have time or have they moved the
08:26:44.638 timeline of these rot ancestral
08:26:46.680 followers into the future which might
08:26:49.478 make this ancestral follower a scout
08:26:52.280 about to discover a whole new form of
08:26:55.040 power from death and will then lead some
08:26:57.920 of his own onto A New
08:27:00.398 Path what on Earth is worn around the
08:27:03.160 sharman's neck it looks like something
08:27:05.718 that would be left by a creature from
08:27:07.680 June it presumably came to the world
08:27:10.520 like that as it seems complete and the
08:27:13.160 ancestral followers do not make much
08:27:15.200 changes to their bone or antler jewelry
08:27:18.798 perhaps the teeth of this creature grew
08:27:21.000 in layers shedding and regrowing and is
08:27:24.360 therefore a good embodiment of The
08:27:26.318 ancestral beliefs and finally if the
08:27:29.840 Regal ancestral Spirit exists beyond the
08:27:33.080 perview of the earth tree then how and
08:27:36.120 why is its remembrance Hune into the
08:27:38.760 Earth
08:27:40.558 tree finally let's focus on the law of
08:27:43.760 the ancestral followers that has a
08:27:45.840 profound impact on all the law of Elden
08:27:49.478 ring now that we have looked at the
08:27:51.520 ancestral followers culture and
08:27:53.520 practices deeply we can break through to
08:27:56.318 insights that have an impact well beyond
08:27:58.398 this group that lead us to a deeper
08:28:01.120 understanding of the rules of the world
08:28:03.360 as a whole The ancestral followers
08:28:06.238 despite living a distance from the
08:28:07.760 earthree and rejecting its Society still
08:28:11.160 drop runes gold flows out of them and
08:28:15.040 into us when we defeat them now we
08:28:18.000 already know that gold is an inherent
08:28:20.200 property of the world gold existed
08:28:22.840 before the Earth tree and before the
08:28:25.000 greater will worship Faith but the fact
08:28:27.680 that gold comes out of the ancestral
08:28:29.680 followers is important it shows that
08:28:32.798 gold to some extent is involved in life
08:28:36.000 regardless of belief system just as all
08:28:38.878 colors seem to have their own
08:28:40.398 associations and properties regardless
08:28:43.080 of the culture and despite renouncing
08:28:46.360 letters runes still emerge from them on
08:28:49.280 death it therefore would imply that
08:28:51.760 runes are as inherent as color spirit
08:28:56.200 life and so on or that their existence
08:28:59.558 is now at least as irremovable as it is
08:29:03.000 possible to be the ancestral followers
08:29:05.558 seem to not use the power of runes or
08:29:08.238 manipulate the world with the power of
08:29:10.000 letters but it seems as though runes are
08:29:12.360 a fundamental part of the world and are
08:29:15.280 inherently connected to it in the
08:29:17.878 beginning was the word and the Word was
08:29:21.200 with God and the Word was God much like
08:29:25.120 runes in Nordic mythology runes in Elden
08:29:28.000 ring are truly magic there is one fine
08:29:32.280 difference between the ancestral
08:29:33.718 followers that while subtle is important
08:29:36.718 here those who wear the two pronged
08:29:38.840 horns do have bright blue eyes as we
08:29:41.638 have mentioned but the Chans who wear a
08:29:44.600 headband with many buds do not have the
08:29:47.478 same eye color their eyes are a more
08:29:50.840 neutral color light blue sometimes and
08:29:54.398 sometimes gray or perhaps perhaps silver
08:29:57.718 this is already interesting but is in
08:30:00.120 fact the beginning of what might be a
08:30:02.798 deeply profound distinction the next
08:30:05.718 thing revealed on close examination is
08:30:08.318 that on The Shining horn headband there
08:30:10.798 hang diss of metal for a people who have
08:30:14.798 given up metal working this is an
08:30:17.318 interesting choice Perhaps it is a
08:30:20.238 naturally occurring example of metal but
08:30:23.080 what is most interesting is why it is
08:30:25.718 there
08:30:26.638 what does it represent another disparity
08:30:29.440 to notice is behavior as well as a
08:30:32.280 difference in the motion or behavor of
08:30:34.558 spirit energy during their rituals it is
08:30:37.360 only the shamans who sing when no Shaman
08:30:40.638 is present there is silence broken only
08:30:43.680 by rhythmic
08:30:46.680 stamping another difference is how they
08:30:49.160 respond to our presence the shamans are
08:30:52.080 less aggressive than the Warriors and
08:30:54.238 they have a much smaller area in which
08:30:56.398 they will attack during their rituals
08:30:59.360 with their eyes closed they almost seem
08:31:01.680 to be in a trance perhaps shared by The
08:31:05.840 Warriors so profoundly connected to
08:31:08.558 Spirit that they are much less aware of
08:31:10.798 their mundane surroundings though when
08:31:13.878 it comes to it these shamans are
08:31:16.200 definitely capable of aggression in fact
08:31:19.238 on proper
08:31:21.958 testing they are extremely strong they
08:31:25.398 are big and even more tanky than the
08:31:28.040 warriors with higher HP and resistance
08:31:31.638 they can also use the ancestral infants
08:31:33.878 head to Channel A Life sapping spirit
08:31:36.718 myasthma yet despite all this power they
08:31:39.760 are not armed and are not quick to anger
08:31:43.238 even once we attack them they do not go
08:31:45.558 for allout offense preferring to cradle
08:31:48.680 the precious ancestral infant head in
08:31:51.280 one arm like a precious child while
08:31:54.160 buffeting us back with the other all of
08:31:57.080 this taken together gives a clear sense
08:31:59.718 of divided roles and one more obvious
08:32:03.280 observation that we have yet to mention
08:32:05.440 is that these two roles are divided
08:32:07.558 another way the shaman are female while
08:32:10.958 the Warriors are male similar separate
08:32:13.840 roles are present in the earthree
08:32:15.718 society too and while they may have more
08:32:18.120 complexity here it is certainly telling
08:32:20.680 that these two cultures share this
08:32:22.718 feature given their history the next
08:32:26.160 discovery that the ancestral followers
08:32:27.920 give us is best discussed with the
08:32:30.440 question what is the importance of a
08:32:33.478 consort why does America need an Elden
08:32:36.558 Lord why does Ronnie need us for her new
08:32:39.840 order what does MOG steal Micha for in
08:32:43.798 general there seems to be an essential
08:32:45.798 relationship between a king and a queen
08:32:48.840 a ruler and a consort or even a God and
08:32:52.280 their king or queen the ancestral
08:32:55.080 followers seem seem to show that this to
08:32:57.600 is an essential aspect of the world and
08:33:00.798 not just a whim of certain gods or Omens
08:33:04.520 the distinct roles are divided by gender
08:33:07.398 with the ancestral followers but we
08:33:09.238 don't know if this is a rule as such
08:33:12.040 though for the orders that we know have
08:33:13.760 existed in history there has been a
08:33:16.318 queen and a king consort additionally
08:33:19.478 there is something else that is
08:33:21.160 essential in Elden ring having a maiden
08:33:25.760 regardless of what body type the player
08:33:27.760 chooses they are always met with the
08:33:30.360 same cruel phrase from VAR you are
08:33:35.238 Maiden what is it in Elden ring that
08:33:37.760 women can achieve or have been chosen to
08:33:40.440 perform that men cannot the finger
08:33:43.638 readers are female the nox Society seems
08:33:47.360 matriarchal the Glide Queen is female
08:33:51.040 while this could be coincidence it does
08:33:53.280 seem that the importance of women or the
08:33:55.398 female male role is something essential
08:33:57.840 in the world of Elden ring to access
08:34:00.360 certain domains of
08:34:02.398 power returning to the Shaman's eye
08:34:05.040 color perhaps the paler blue or more
08:34:07.798 gray or silver represents this
08:34:10.280 channeling of life we can see her
08:34:12.840 Channel and send out spirit Power in her
08:34:15.360 rituals sending it out of her spirit
08:34:18.520 moves out and away from her where it is
08:34:21.958 absorbed by the hunters the Shaman's
08:34:25.000 differences seem to Center on the
08:34:26.798 quality of lifegiving if we look closely
08:34:30.280 at her shining horn headband we cannot
08:34:32.920 help but be pushed to the concept of a
08:34:35.318 tree and fruit again and again the
08:34:38.840 similarity of antlers to branches has
08:34:41.440 been made in art history mythology and
08:34:45.718 in Elden ring itself branching sprouting
08:34:50.760 fertility
08:34:52.318 ancestry with the hanging medallions
08:34:54.958 that seem to be silver if we think in
08:34:57.440 terms of Elden ring it makes us think of
08:35:01.080 life in fact these pendants look an
08:35:03.878 awful lot like silver tears if the Earth
08:35:07.440 tree Bears the living out of its bowels
08:35:10.120 so too might the ancestral King bear out
08:35:12.760 the new births of the ancestral
08:35:14.798 followers not from its bows and branches
08:35:18.238 but from its antlers fire its own flow
08:35:21.238 of life and soul energy and not with
08:35:24.520 metal working but as a natural process
08:35:28.520 this form of hanging also gives the
08:35:30.638 concept of fruit or buds similar to The
08:35:34.760 Scarlet aonia or the Earth tree itself
08:35:38.280 but the ancestral follower beyond the
08:35:40.478 purview of the earth tree is independent
08:35:43.280 from it and can birth its own this leads
08:35:47.718 us to the more General aspect of
08:35:50.080 relation having shown that age is not
08:35:52.440 important for the concept of relation or
08:35:55.000 ancestry with an infant ancestral head
08:35:57.920 still being capable of being an
08:36:00.000 ancestral Spirit we are left with the
08:36:03.398 conclusion all things can be
08:36:06.478 conjoined therefore the primary quality
08:36:09.238 of the antlers is to unite to channel to
08:36:12.958 relate and unify all in a chain of
08:36:17.680 relation it would seem that Elden ring
08:36:20.040 emphasizes the importance and uniqueness
08:36:23.160 of Womanhood and this is not Sur Rising
08:36:26.160 given the history of the essential role
08:36:28.280 women played as FireKeepers in past
08:36:31.040 games or their essential difference in
08:36:34.318 influence power and magic in Martin's
08:36:37.760 work women may be deeply connected to
08:36:40.638 the power of birth even if they are
08:36:42.878 somewhat removed from it in a
08:36:45.120 traditional physical sense and the
08:36:47.478 ancestral followers clearly draw
08:36:49.478 attention to this the difference in
08:36:52.120 their involvement in spirit energy is
08:36:54.478 shown by more than than just the
08:36:56.120 sharman's eyes the female ancestral
08:36:59.238 follower is always physical they are
08:37:02.318 never in spirit form unlike the hunters
08:37:06.280 notice too the difference in horns only
08:37:09.840 two compared to many as though the males
08:37:12.958 were a peak and the female was more the
08:37:16.040 central bow the nourishing Force the
08:37:19.600 males draw the force and may then expend
08:37:22.600 it but the female May channel that power
08:37:26.318 they distribute it if this was the case
08:37:29.878 then either one without the other is
08:37:32.080 powerless as both roles contribute in
08:37:35.080 relation to an effective whole once
08:37:38.120 again the ancestral followers have found
08:37:40.398 a Harmony in relations unlike Marica who
08:37:44.840 damages her order with imbalance or MOG
08:37:48.718 who violently takes Nia without his
08:37:51.878 consent since that day MOG has heard
08:37:54.798 nothing from from him and the mwin
08:37:56.878 dynasty has yet become a
08:38:01.360 reality the female in some form may be
08:38:04.798 required for some aspects of birth or
08:38:08.000 new life and nourishment of that life
08:38:11.600 perhaps these aspects of Womanhood are a
08:38:14.200 central and profound aspect of the world
08:38:16.958 of Elden ring and are bound spiritually
08:38:20.160 as much as physically it may be that in
08:38:23.398 a spiritual sense everyone one has a
08:38:26.360 mother even those less traditionally
08:38:29.280 born the culture of the ancestral
08:38:31.798 followers is working it is something
08:38:34.558 rare in the world of Elden ring but it
08:38:36.958 feels like a group that actually has a
08:38:39.360 bright future while the ancestral
08:38:41.760 followers may not have flourished to the
08:38:43.878 size and scale of certain other
08:38:45.920 subgroups in the lands between they are
08:38:48.600 young and unlike so many in our world or
08:38:52.238 in art they have succeeded in departing
08:38:55.000 from Society this is an incredible
08:38:58.040 achievement as nature presents a very
08:39:00.680 steep learning curve they have adapted
08:39:04.080 they have aligned themselves with nature
08:39:06.360 and their craft of surviving with nature
08:39:08.760 is more than sustainable they have
08:39:11.040 raised an ancestral infant all the way
08:39:13.878 to becoming a king they have proven
08:39:16.878 their faith and have developed their own
08:39:19.558 distinctive spiritual Arts all of this
08:39:22.798 is a remarkable achievement for a group
08:39:25.000 that turned away from a failing system
08:39:27.398 to Begin Again on their own even if we
08:39:30.958 slay their King they have others ready
08:39:33.478 to rise up they Embrace competition they
08:39:36.920 Embrace death their order is young but
08:39:40.760 think how many sproutings it might bear
08:39:44.080 how many connections how many relations
08:39:47.798 once enough relations have been formed
08:39:50.440 it is an answer to the life death cycle
08:39:53.798 it can be its own order and eventually a
08:39:57.920 competitor to other
08:39:59.840 orders this gives enormous insight to
08:40:02.878 other aspects of the Elden ring world
08:40:05.520 for example godric may not be a sorely
08:40:08.798 diluted distant relation to America from
08:40:11.920 time related ancestry as we would think
08:40:14.478 of in our world but from his dilution of
08:40:17.638 relations from grating The ancestral
08:40:21.040 infant head showed us that time is not
08:40:23.600 the measurement being made and it makes
08:40:26.478 us reflect if the antlers and its
08:40:28.958 relations are much more flexible than in
08:40:31.318 our world what about the other
08:40:33.440 connectors at the center of other orders
08:40:36.920 the Earth tree itself may not be so
08:40:39.760 different in fact this similarity with
08:40:43.080 the tree and its fruit is more than
08:40:46.238 speculation there is a reason they use
08:40:49.040 the unclear word buds after all are buds
08:40:53.878 horns or PL
08:40:56.238 but this term was kept ambiguous because
08:40:59.318 it is ambiguous in classic from soft
08:41:03.520 style they hid the answer in plain sight
08:41:07.680 for if you look closely the tips of the
08:41:11.398 antlers are becoming leaves
08:41:16.160 [Music]
08:41:33.880 [Applause]
08:41:38.200 [Music]
08:41:47.160 welcome to another episode of L before
08:41:49.680 bed Elden ringtales for this episode we
08:41:53.840 will be looking at the perception of
08:41:55.478 characters compared to who they really
08:41:57.958 are in the lands between the gods and
08:42:01.120 demigods are perceived as being
08:42:03.200 ferocious cruel kind or intelligent by
08:42:07.120 the culture that surrounds them and for
08:42:09.440 the most part by the players of Elden
08:42:11.200 ring themselves but we wonder if this
08:42:14.200 isn't always as it
08:42:16.280 seems America is seen as monstrous cruel
08:42:20.440 and tyrannical she locks up her own
08:42:23.040 children below the capital she Exiles
08:42:25.680 her own husband she steals a husband
08:42:28.520 from rala she wages war and eventually
08:42:32.000 causes the shattering forcing her own
08:42:34.398 children to fight amongst themselves
08:42:37.398 while these actions aren't kind in
08:42:39.398 general they've been interpreted as
08:42:41.638 deliberate that is that Amica is in
08:42:44.160 control when she does this a calculating
08:42:46.920 goddess who is in the driver's seat but
08:42:49.878 what if she wasn't so competent what if
08:42:52.680 she was persuaded to act how she did by
08:42:54.840 others
08:42:55.920 or was in a panic very often and out of
08:42:58.798 her depth while it wouldn't be cruel it
08:43:01.680 would make her less of a monster and
08:43:03.558 more someone careless selfish and
08:43:06.478 without ability to rule we are not
08:43:09.160 claiming this is the truth but want to
08:43:11.558 examine it as a way to get to the truth
08:43:13.680 about
08:43:15.280 America Her First Act of War has Little
08:43:18.238 America involved down comes the Elden
08:43:21.080 Beast and the greater Will's influence
08:43:23.040 is brought to bear we follow the fingers
08:43:25.840 judgment and advice quite readily when
08:43:28.000 we are promised power and if the fingers
08:43:30.440 were present then they would have
08:43:32.120 promised America godhood pour Temptation
08:43:35.840 into a naive mind and they can put
08:43:38.080 things into motion America was part of
08:43:40.958 the new women and so was involved in the
08:43:43.360 society before the Earth tree but we
08:43:45.920 don't hear about America until she is
08:43:47.958 the ruler of the earthree society so she
08:43:51.200 was
08:43:52.558 nobody but with Amica as the figure head
08:43:55.558 who does the bulk of the fighting
08:43:57.958 Godfrey Godfrey is mentioned everywhere
08:44:00.520 in the lands between Godfrey and his
08:44:02.878 armies won countless victories all while
08:44:05.318 America seems to have stayed safely at
08:44:07.280 the capital Godfrey wasn't chosen to
08:44:09.878 rule as the greater will knew he would
08:44:11.878 be unfit to lead he had to take SOS on
08:44:15.080 his back just to conduct himself as
08:44:17.080 America's consort he was meant for war
08:44:21.120 and so America takes the credit for
08:44:23.238 Godfrey's barbarism
08:44:25.760 next is the locking up of her children
08:44:28.440 this may be totally unforgivable but why
08:44:31.080 did it happen who advised that it needed
08:44:34.040 to be done were Omens a surprise at this
08:44:37.280 early date Godfrey knows morot and seems
08:44:40.840 to pity him a culture arose that
08:44:43.680 accepted and worked with the locking up
08:44:45.878 of Omens so many mothers not only Marica
08:44:49.558 that chose this act once again perhaps
08:44:52.878 America knew what to do and thought fast
08:44:55.238 on her feet and came up with a brutal
08:44:58.080 solution or perhaps once again it was
08:45:00.878 the finger maidens and the two fingers
08:45:03.398 whispering in her
08:45:05.280 ears let's put it another way in every
08:45:08.200 game for Mia Aki the theme of ego and
08:45:11.000 foolishness is used get the undead
08:45:13.798 excited about being the chosen one in
08:45:15.878 order to get what you want achieved but
08:45:18.558 this is true for every scale isn't it
08:45:21.478 look at the greater Will's Dominion
08:45:23.760 there are many world trees the greater
08:45:26.360 will has done this before if you choose
08:45:29.160 someone who can't understand what is
08:45:31.160 going on the simpler they will be to
08:45:33.760 guide the idea that America is
08:45:36.080 desperately trying to keep up and maybe
08:45:38.398 even suffering from impostor syndrome
08:45:40.680 should definitely be looked into you can
08:45:43.638 be evil and not all that in control
08:45:46.398 which may be the case with America and
08:45:48.680 other George R R Martin's characters of
08:45:51.080 the past
08:45:57.080 we hope you're enjoying this episode of

08:46:30.638 format on the channel we hope you'll
08:46:32.718 consider supporting what we do thank
08:46:38.520 you another character who may not be who
08:46:41.638 they seem is melan she seems to be
08:46:44.638 caring and a victim of her mother's
08:46:46.680 wishes but many have asked how she knows
08:46:49.318 we are maiden lless and how she can
08:46:51.440 fulfill the role of Maiden added to the
08:46:54.280 fact that they maybe some connection
08:46:56.160 between her and destined death with some
08:46:58.798 thinking she must be the Glide Queen it
08:47:01.360 would seem unlikely that she is acting
08:47:03.760 naively she couldn't Shepherd us all
08:47:06.238 this way by accident just how much is
08:47:09.558 she pretending we do not know there is a
08:47:12.680 lot she doesn't tell us after all she
08:47:15.360 can be summoned in a fight and she uses
08:47:17.520 a spell that conjures an urry that could
08:47:20.280 be seen as
08:47:21.558 burning even being able to cast this
08:47:23.958 spell is of Interest interest she wasn't
08:47:26.318 born yesterday but where did she learn
08:47:28.840 this from what does it imply and how
08:47:32.200 much is she pretending to not
08:47:35.238 know a few more obvious ones who are not
08:47:38.478 what they first appear are Gideon who
08:47:41.160 isn't that smart in the end Redan who
08:47:43.920 isn't such a war monster but instead
08:47:46.360 cares deeply for his horse and bogot who
08:47:50.360 after some time becomes an all right guy
08:47:53.798 but what if some of the other big
08:47:55.440 players were equally
08:47:57.160 paradoxical Everyone likes Ronnie and
08:47:59.840 she seems very likable but she is
08:48:02.280 definitely more ruthless than she seems
08:48:05.360 it is not her against the world as she
08:48:07.280 makes it seem there are threads that
08:48:09.600 link her to other plts she couldn't do
08:48:12.318 what she does with blly eg and a
08:48:15.080 traitorous Salis one Ally was of course
08:48:18.760 reart she gave him the Blasphemous claw
08:48:21.638 as a backup on the night of the black
08:48:23.718 knives and Reichard had armies with him
08:48:27.718 she is also very likely linked with
08:48:29.798 torrent who is used to start a new plot
08:48:32.520 to overthrow the old order torrent Old
08:48:35.718 owner gave her the whistle so she has
08:48:38.718 much more support than she lets on she
08:48:42.120 also knows she needs a consort and we
08:48:44.840 can fill that role does she really care
08:48:47.478 for us or is this requirement
08:48:50.120 unavoidable we certainly haven't done
08:48:52.318 anything for her other than slay her
08:48:54.280 enemies
08:48:55.878 the only sense of real affection she
08:48:57.680 does show is when we stay committed to
08:49:00.000 her despite the semi absurdity of her
08:49:02.680 plan laid
08:49:04.360 bare some are exactly as they seem
08:49:07.920 tanith doesn't surprise us from
08:49:09.920 beginning to end Devotion to her Lord
08:49:13.040 and
08:49:13.878 cause Godfrey lived up to his
08:49:17.200 reputation reputation leads us to
08:49:19.520 another Topic in the lines between what
08:49:22.398 is achieved by it Redan needs an
08:49:25.080 honorable death and simply through his
08:49:27.360 reputation he draws Warriors from miles
08:49:30.558 around the challenge to defeat him in
08:49:33.200 the Festival of combat is a hard cell
08:49:35.878 but redan's reputation is such that many
08:49:38.398 make the pilgrimage the reputation of
08:49:41.360 Godfrey would have sewed fear into the
08:49:43.360 hearts of his enemies before the war
08:49:45.360 even began and amica's reputation of
08:49:49.398 ruthlessly crushing those in her way and
08:49:51.920 exacting her revenge would have kept
08:49:54.200 many in line not forever as we know but
08:49:58.200 this reputation whether literally true
08:50:00.840 or not makes many do as she wishes the
08:50:04.200 blacksmith hugue to this day lives in
08:50:06.958 fear of her he is chained to the place
08:50:09.600 he works but surely Escape is possible
08:50:12.958 eventually especially once the Earth
08:50:15.120 tree is burnt but he does not consider
08:50:17.878 it just by reputation she holds him in
08:50:21.280 place even though she is held in place
08:50:24.080 by an even stronger
08:50:26.478 adversary reputation is also a tool of
08:50:30.000 michas he is known as a young girl and a
08:50:33.318 young boy whether he is Trina or Mika he
08:50:36.958 is known as Dreadful or sweet and kind
08:50:40.600 it is said he is aware of this and uses
08:50:43.200 it to his Advantage he doesn't just use
08:50:46.238 materials to Fashion great designs he
08:50:49.160 uses
08:50:50.478 others some people we know only by
08:50:53.558 reputation Rena is reputed to have been
08:50:56.280 a witch and daughter of renala yet we
08:50:59.440 never meet her many have wondered if
08:51:02.040 this is just a ploy of Ries she does at
08:51:04.798 one point claim to be Rena there are
08:51:07.680 other Towers implying other daughters
08:51:10.558 the reputation of these daughters is
08:51:12.520 rather slim considering the amount of
08:51:14.478 law linking ranii Redan and rard to the
08:51:18.360 parents morgot Rules by reputation he
08:51:22.080 cannot be seen by those he rules over as
08:51:24.760 he would be rejected by them he is an
08:51:27.280 omen fit for beneath the capital fit for
08:51:30.840 a cell not fit for a crown morgot has to
08:51:34.798 do everything with his words yet with
08:51:37.878 only his reputation he succeeds he
08:51:41.160 inspires fear into others and also love
08:51:45.680 Nobles cannot wait to meet the Monarch
08:51:47.840 and dream of the opportunity they Revere
08:51:50.718 the ruler and respect him his reputation
08:51:54.000 makes them unquestioningly loyal they
08:51:56.840 have no suspicion that their Monarch is
08:51:59.120 an omen this is before getting into the
08:52:02.080 reputation of the lands themselves the
08:52:05.000 capital lendelle is reported to be
08:52:07.238 beautiful it is desirable to live there
08:52:10.040 and living close to the Earth tree is to
08:52:12.040 be blessed when we first see it from far
08:52:15.200 away it looks stunning but closer up the
08:52:19.558 reputation Is Not What It Seems the
08:52:22.280 sound of those locked away comes up from
08:52:24.680 below and these practically outnumber
08:52:27.440 the actual citizens the beauty when seen
08:52:30.798 up close is fading and damaged many
08:52:34.280 buildings are sealed up with corpse wax
08:52:37.080 which makes you wonder where it came
08:52:38.760 from plant growth is everywhere there
08:52:41.520 are more soldiers than residents
08:52:44.160 conversely the land of the nox while far
08:52:47.080 from a paradise has a sense that the
08:52:49.440 people there live there and are not only
08:52:52.160 soldiers sworn to protect it it is not
08:52:54.878 in a good state but it is not so rotten
08:52:57.558 from within somehow micha's halig tree
08:53:01.120 has a reputation of promise but is it
08:53:04.280 long gone Micha himself is long gone but
08:53:07.718 even before that there is evidence that
08:53:09.680 his plans weren't working very few of
08:53:12.558 the Alban orics have reached this
08:53:14.040 promised land and perhaps michelo will
08:53:16.958 never succeed in sealing the outer Gods
08:53:19.478 entirely it has never worked before one
08:53:22.920 reputation that lives up is for the
08:53:25.040 Scarlet rot infested kalid both in the
08:53:28.200 Elder ring community and in the game
08:53:30.360 itself the reputation of the awful Place
08:53:33.000 does it justice much larger than it
08:53:35.600 should be the endless Scarlet rot is
08:53:38.520 tiresome the visuals are tiring the
08:53:41.280 enemies are weird gross and hard to
08:53:44.318 fight the cleanliness of redan's feeding
08:53:47.120 ground was a vast
08:53:48.638 Improvement that beach is like a holiday
08:53:51.080 compared to most of kalid we don't know
08:53:54.398 which we dislike the most the crows or
08:53:56.958 the dogs the pests are all right though
08:54:00.000 they are interesting have law and have
08:54:02.600 more variety besides millenia's children
08:54:05.920 have a right to the Scarlet rot
08:54:08.558 land Leonia may not live up to its
08:54:11.478 reputation much longer as it is sinking
08:54:14.718 we will soon find no Academy at all the
08:54:18.040 question is is it preventable Leonia has
08:54:21.360 the reputation of remarkable magic Fame
08:54:24.680 could it use remarkable magic to prevent
08:54:26.840 the fall into the pit beneath it could
08:54:29.680 they harness the power of the crystals
08:54:31.558 beneath it perhaps what keeps it up the
08:54:35.360 general sense of lania is not that
08:54:37.440 different from the capital faded power
08:54:40.840 renala seems to have lost her mind the
08:54:43.558 other heads of conspectus have gone
08:54:46.478 selin easily regains the center of the
08:54:49.040 academy and it takes jiren to remove her
08:54:51.798 from it in Truth there is no reason
08:54:54.318 region that really succeeds in the game
08:54:56.840 micha's land is new but already
08:54:59.200 encountering grave problems the Dragon's
08:55:02.080 land is crumbling the KNX buried the
08:55:05.798 capital sick and the academy sinking
08:55:09.280 into the Earth its members few and
08:55:13.160 Wayward the lands between in general
08:55:15.760 lacks any sense of purpose or
08:55:18.840 hopefulness the general stalemate has
08:55:21.280 led to the attempt of using us the
08:55:23.760 player as a solution to create a new
08:55:26.360 order but to put as the ruler one such
08:55:29.280 as us shows how dire things are what
08:55:32.600 would we know about ruling and if we can
08:55:35.440 be placed there doesn't it say something
08:55:37.680 about the greater will and the previous
08:55:39.920 choice of America we have only killed to
08:55:43.238 arrive here we do not know how to run
08:55:45.600 the lands between but this is what it
08:55:47.920 took to shake the world out of a
08:55:50.120 deadlock the truth is the greater will
08:55:52.680 knows that we won't last long
08:55:54.878 our rule will be
08:55:56.398 fleeting we were just the kick that
08:55:58.920 unjammed the engine ruling won't be our
08:56:01.958 place and the next true ruler to arrive
08:56:05.200 will unseat US leading to a new cycle
08:56:09.238 and this is from software's place for us
08:56:12.120 for a simple and Confused starting
08:56:14.600 player what could we be but the surprise
08:56:17.920 the bit of chaos That Shook things out
08:56:20.520 from
08:56:21.398 stagnation that isn't Ronnie's role or
08:56:24.440 cards or godre they are too great for
08:56:27.958 that it is the role of a lonely
08:56:33.710 [Music]
08:56:39.398 tarnished the future is decided decided
08:56:43.558 by who can the owner of this decision
08:56:46.520 change are those of us in the lands
08:56:49.120 between simply playing out these
08:56:51.840 decisions how are our senses functioning
08:56:55.200 how do they work how are they different
08:56:58.040 in Elden ring do they lie to us or do
08:57:01.760 they reveal
08:57:03.000 Mysteries how can we see the stars and
08:57:05.558 tell the future why can the Stars
08:57:08.318 control Our Fate and why is this no
08:57:10.798 longer the
08:57:11.958 case why is there no future for those
08:57:14.638 with no
08:57:15.920 fate welcome to an examination on the
08:57:18.920 complex aspects of the senses reality
08:57:22.558 the future fate
08:57:24.680 cause and effect the stars and the
08:57:28.040 mysterious ways that some of the basic
08:57:30.280 rules of our world have been changed for
08:57:32.638 the universe of Elden
08:57:35.398 ring what exactly is the relationship
08:57:38.200 between the senses and reality in Elden
08:57:40.718 ring it seems that this relationship is
08:57:44.040 much more interrelational than in our
08:57:46.360 world in our world the senses seem to
08:57:49.280 primarily uptake data for the most part
08:57:52.558 they receive and interpret data of a
08:57:55.040 certain kind sound waves light and so on
08:57:59.360 it is rare if at all that the absorption
08:58:01.920 of the data has an impact on the world
08:58:04.360 out there instead our intelligence has
08:58:07.360 to interpret the data and decisions and
08:58:10.200 actions must be carried out however in
08:58:13.120 Elden ring this is not the case it seems
08:58:16.040 that the simple Act of seeing hearing
08:58:19.440 touching and so on can have large
08:58:22.440 consequences
08:58:24.160 an astrologer is said to have died on
08:58:26.760 seeing the collapse of a star while
08:58:29.638 senses can be so intense as to cause
08:58:31.920 death occasionally in our world here
08:58:34.718 that is not implied it is as though on
08:58:37.798 seeing something the witness can become
08:58:40.360 paired with what is seen another example
08:58:43.680 of this is founding rign of stars an
08:58:47.000 ancient astrologer is supposed to have
08:58:49.238 glimpsed the Primeval current which
08:58:51.958 became real and the STS amber rain down
08:58:55.478 on this land this was the founding
08:58:58.280 Glenstone sorcery simply glimpsing
08:59:01.478 something not only made it real but
08:59:03.958 seemed to cause a remarkable and unique
08:59:06.398 weather effect across the world this
08:59:09.120 obsession with the senses and sight goes
08:59:11.798 much further blindfolds are everywhere
08:59:14.878 in the game even on character choice and
08:59:17.680 creation they are a theme we were struck
08:59:20.958 by this when first playing surely it is
08:59:23.600 impossible I to operate in the world
08:59:25.478 with your eyes blindfolded and it breaks
08:59:28.040 the sense of realism to have your
08:59:29.920 character
08:59:31.000 blindfolded it seems to overtly say that
08:59:33.318 there is a person controlling you or
08:59:35.798 controlling your character and yet this
08:59:39.280 seems to be another layer to the mystery
08:59:41.520 of the operation of the senses in Elden
08:59:43.798 ring not only are the senses more
08:59:46.360 significant in some ways but in other
08:59:48.718 ways they can be
08:59:50.440 irrelevant they can be unnecessary
08:59:53.440 because the senses and this time just
08:59:55.920 like in our world linked to time and the
08:59:59.360 future the item profit blindfold says
09:00:03.360 why hesitate if the path leading to the
09:00:05.840 future is clear just close your eyes and
09:00:09.840 walk another description given in the
09:00:12.478 CNT before the game release says what
09:00:15.398 uses eyesight to those who claim to know
09:00:17.760 the true path Elden ring seems to say
09:00:21.520 here what is the purpose of the senses
09:00:24.440 in reality why do we really use our
09:00:28.280 senses and if you knew the future your
09:00:31.478 true path your true course of action
09:00:34.638 knew it fully aren't the senses
09:00:37.638 useless if you know when the lights will
09:00:40.440 turn green what someone will say and
09:00:43.638 when when you will meet someone do you
09:00:47.000 need your senses to what extent are the
09:00:50.360 senses needed to those who know the
09:00:52.360 future exactly the senses are required
09:00:55.600 by those who do not know what might
09:00:57.600 happen for those who operate in the
09:01:00.120 unknown therefore a willful blindfolding
09:01:03.040 May speed up your journey through your
09:01:05.478 future the fastest path to the true path
09:01:09.120 uninterrupted by other sensory
09:01:11.760 data what about another blind character
09:01:15.080 the blind Maiden haetta we feed her
09:01:17.878 shabiri grapes this is to guide her to
09:01:21.558 the distant light how can she be guided
09:01:24.718 by light if she's blind she says she
09:01:27.840 feels a light at the back of her eyes
09:01:31.280 well the senses are ultimately in the
09:01:33.718 mind and within oneself one's
09:01:36.760 consciousness consumptions of things in
09:01:38.958 Elden ring may lead to the sense of
09:01:40.840 sight being affected in that you do not
09:01:43.478 need eyes necessarily to see this is
09:01:47.318 true even in humans ultimately the
09:01:49.840 signal is passed Downstream and the
09:01:52.478 receiver is what registers it as sight
09:01:55.280 but the signal that was sent could be
09:01:57.200 hacked
09:01:59.280 theoretically now given this Guiding
09:02:01.520 Light which seems to bypass blindness
09:02:04.318 and appear in the realm of sight that we
09:02:06.958 experience the maiden passes through the
09:02:09.520 world unseeing and perhaps almost unseen
09:02:14.200 and may very well find her way think
09:02:17.478 about that
09:02:18.558 choice Miaki and from software have
09:02:21.840 decided to put us in a world where a
09:02:23.920 minute lack of attention can cause death
09:02:27.478 now imagine playing
09:02:29.600 blindfolded it would be practically
09:02:31.840 impossible and if achieved would be more
09:02:34.718 impressive than any speedrun yet they
09:02:37.600 have put in characters plural who
09:02:40.360 progress in game and progress far who
09:02:43.360 are quite literally
09:02:45.760 blind perhaps this is because after all
09:02:49.280 the future is set and there are ways to
09:02:52.398 navigate that we can't stand easily in
09:02:54.840 the way we view the world if you could
09:02:57.600 tap into the absolute future constantly
09:03:00.920 a blindfold would hardly be a hindrance
09:03:03.798 even Rani with all her power and
09:03:06.440 intelligence cannot progress her own
09:03:08.680 life for a great deal of time when her
09:03:11.080 fate or future is locked all her action
09:03:15.360 and response to her senses are worthless
09:03:17.958 until the stars that dictate her fate
09:03:19.958 are permitted to move again her
09:03:22.520 intelligence seems to only have a use in
09:03:25.000 pursuit of that goal she cannot progress
09:03:28.200 her future
09:03:30.958 directly another sense that has
09:03:33.238 interesting differences in Elden ring is
09:03:36.000 scent perfuming is of course the craft
09:03:39.120 that takes the most advantage of this
09:03:40.958 sense it is not just that this sense is
09:03:43.958 interesting it is that this sense is so
09:03:46.680 powerful and effective these perfumers
09:03:49.840 can create mad emotions beautiful dreams
09:03:53.718 a sense of invulnerability a real
09:03:56.360 physical protection all seemingly from
09:03:59.920 the
09:04:00.600 senses while it may be a chemical
09:04:03.160 process it would seem that belief can be
09:04:05.638 achieved from scent as well as
09:04:08.680 sight similar to the belief that sight
09:04:11.318 can imbue how do we know that these
09:04:13.440 scents do anything other than imbue a
09:04:15.520 belief through another Channel and that
09:04:18.280 the Mad confidence and increased damage
09:04:21.280 or increased protection of those under
09:04:23.440 their effects is anything more than the
09:04:25.958 reality of Elden ring that belief has a
09:04:29.200 much more tangible effect on reality
09:04:31.440 than in our world it is a peculiar
09:04:34.360 choice not to have Alchemists or potion
09:04:37.318 Maes or anything else in the game that
09:04:39.558 would be a more traditional Choice it is
09:04:42.920 an active choice to have those who work
09:04:45.520 with a sense the sense of smell and once
09:04:49.558 again it is remarkable the impact that
09:04:51.718 this has perfumers effectively operate
09:04:54.798 the leading Medicine of the capital a
09:04:57.360 leading War tool just by designing that
09:05:00.160 which activates smell intensely once
09:05:03.360 again the quality of Senses making
09:05:05.558 something real of the relationship
09:05:08.238 between senses and reality being extreme
09:05:11.558 and tangible of Senses affecting the
09:05:14.558 real
09:05:16.680 world the next important aspect of Elden
09:05:19.440 ring that links intensely to senses but
09:05:22.160 is different is thought thought thought
09:05:25.120 too seems to operate differently to our
09:05:27.600 world in our world if we think it may
09:05:30.798 lead to actions conclusions changes
09:05:34.798 attitudes all of this has an impact
09:05:37.520 perhaps not as quickly or as easily as
09:05:40.160 we might wish but thoughts have real
09:05:42.440 world consequences certainly however in
09:05:45.398 Elden ring it seems that thought itself
09:05:48.440 has an incredible power and brings
09:05:51.080 things into reality in a much more
09:05:53.280 direct direct
09:05:54.680 way Stars themselves seem to be beings
09:05:57.920 of intelligence and thought and those
09:06:00.600 who have become closer to them have
09:06:02.478 become inorganic still
09:06:06.080 pensive Celestial Jew says Once Upon a
09:06:09.839 Time the stars of the night sky guided
09:06:12.680 fate almost as if we in the lands
09:06:15.718 between are the plane of thoughts of the
09:06:18.360 Stars themselves directed and made in
09:06:21.800 motion by them dictated by them our
09:06:26.237 patterns of activity only an illusion
09:06:29.237 and instead our existence entirely a
09:06:32.040 result of theirs when Redan challenged
09:06:35.078 the stars and arrested their Cycles
09:06:37.917 according to Salis rani's Destiny stops
09:06:41.237 and her Destiny can only continue if
09:06:43.278 they resume their motion which ran is
09:06:45.877 holding back is this with gravity magic
09:06:49.718 and why is Ron's fate halted it can't
09:06:52.557 simply be that a comet has to fall for
09:06:54.839 her to continue her aim is to kill her
09:06:57.278 two fingers and start a new age of the
09:06:59.718 Moon it seems more that her future is
09:07:03.000 literally locked it isn't just ronies it
09:07:06.718 is fate in general astrologer Hood says
09:07:10.237 they read fate in the stars but alas the
09:07:13.438 night sky no longer cradles fate the
09:07:16.800 stars above seemed to dictate the future
09:07:20.237 or did the reading or looking up at them
09:07:22.480 cause the future to
09:07:23.960 happen this distanced meddling of cause
09:07:27.519 and effect seeming to be dictated by
09:07:30.000 thought or motions of other beings is
09:07:32.718 shown again with unalloyed gold needle
09:07:36.160 among other things crafted to Ward away
09:07:39.758 the meddling of outer Gods how does this
09:07:42.917 work the incurable rotting sickness
09:07:46.199 incurable by any medicine perfume
09:07:49.122 activity or spell is halted by a device
09:07:52.199 that stops the meddling of an outer God
09:07:55.320 it would seem that just as Ron's fate is
09:07:57.438 stalled even the progress of what would
09:07:59.877 be thought of as an inanimate thing a
09:08:02.480 rot infection is actually caused to
09:08:05.199 progress into the future by something
09:08:07.398 that seems totally separate the plane of
09:08:09.839 existence we are in to stop these outer
09:08:13.237 Gods meddling also does what
09:08:15.160 fundamentalism could not showing that
09:08:17.917 the position of faith and religion of
09:08:19.917 the golden order seeks not to Halt or
09:08:22.960 change the will of the Gods at least in
09:08:25.877 this instance it seems once again that
09:08:28.640 the processes in the lands between are
09:08:30.758 simply the correlation or the parallel
09:08:33.480 of some other plane a plane of gods or
09:08:37.237 other
09:08:38.078 beings we can delink from this by
09:08:41.122 stalling fate and the stars or stopping
09:08:43.839 the outer God's influence but it seems
09:08:46.199 we cannot be masters of our own Fates
09:08:49.438 the Scarlet rot does not go away instead
09:08:52.839 the pro C dictated by the outer God is
09:08:55.480 simply
09:08:57.040 stalled as though these natural
09:08:59.438 phenomena our own attitudes actions Wars
09:09:04.360 the characters and their Shadows are
09:09:06.960 really a plane of thought emotions
09:09:10.480 attitudes beliefs almost as if the lands
09:09:13.960 between were a Fantastical
09:09:15.917 interpretation of the Mind itself its
09:09:19.800 processes
09:09:21.480 desires fears
09:09:25.640 nuances yet another example of the
09:09:28.078 concept of senses and thought is in the
09:09:30.758 game's mirror Helms EG and those who
09:09:34.160 live in the Eternal cities who have also
09:09:36.680 transgressed use such a Helm it is a
09:09:39.877 mirror that is it reflects visual sense
09:09:43.278 data back out far less extreme than
09:09:46.160 removing one's eyes EEG is so afraid of
09:09:49.519 the greater will he never takes it off
09:09:53.078 of of course it reminds us of the tin
09:09:55.320 foil hat paranoia archetype but EEG is
09:09:58.917 unlikely to be doing this for no reason
09:10:01.598 it seems just like the Scarlet rot is an
09:10:04.320 aspect of an outer God that is operating
09:10:06.758 inside the body the greater will may be
09:10:09.320 able to get inside our heads minds and
09:10:12.122 thoughts through what we see after all
09:10:16.160 is not the guidance of Grace the same
09:10:18.480 thing others do not see it it is not
09:10:21.800 really in the world as it appears to be
09:10:24.557 it is in our heads when the greater will
09:10:28.122 or their two fingers or however the
09:10:30.680 hierarchy Works wishes us to see the
09:10:33.438 path or this guidance we see it if it
09:10:37.438 was in the world it would be universally
09:10:39.839 seen wouldn't it as blackard big bogot
09:10:44.000 says you're tarnished too ain't you can
09:10:47.438 you see it then the guidance of Grace I
09:10:50.237 mean I can't see it at all no more
09:10:53.917 what if this entry into our mind could
09:10:55.800 be stronger than simply the appearance
09:10:57.800 of a visual illusion what if the
09:11:00.320 connection between the senses the Mind
09:11:03.438 reality was such that the greater will
09:11:06.078 could guide our hand Force our hand make
09:11:09.718 us go mad or bend us to their will the
09:11:13.438 name may be a clue the greater
09:11:17.438 will if this is a plane or a world of
09:11:21.160 thought and desire and emotions the
09:11:24.480 greater will is the will that wins if
09:11:27.960 reality is foremost one of thought the
09:11:31.398 force of will to bring things into
09:11:33.237 reality or existence is more important
09:11:35.800 than in our world EEG knows this and bl
09:11:39.877 may have felt
09:11:41.877 it we find once more this idea in Briar
09:11:45.598 of punishment the concept of senses and
09:11:48.758 how sight isn't restricted to the eyes
09:11:50.960 but maybe a plane of actual existence
09:11:53.758 the guilty who discovered the spell have
09:11:56.199 had their eyes gouged out by Thorns they
09:11:59.199 lived in Eternal Darkness there they
09:12:02.199 discovered the Blood star they
09:12:04.839 discovered a star in the visual plane
09:12:07.078 itself is this sight any longer or does
09:12:10.519 the star live in the mind and if they
09:12:13.480 all discovered it together do stars live
09:12:16.040 in our minds collectively a shared
09:12:18.519 reality of mind or a shared reality that
09:12:21.680 all can access through their mind mind
09:12:24.438 this other reality then dictates our
09:12:26.640 Fates as they dictate our thoughts
09:12:29.000 desires and
09:12:30.438 choices an example of a more overt
09:12:33.078 control of desires and choices is on
09:12:35.680 becoming an imperion the greater will
09:12:38.320 forces a shadow to pair to them
09:12:40.718 effectively splitting their intent one
09:12:43.718 is an animal side that embodies certain
09:12:46.199 more intuitive aspects as well as more
09:12:48.877 beastial less societally adapted aspects
09:12:52.877 is is this another form of work on the
09:12:54.877 mind it takes the form of the physical
09:12:57.360 in the lands between but embodying
09:12:59.839 doesn't stop it being uncannily like
09:13:02.160 self-control and impulse aggression and
09:13:06.199 Temperance altruism and ego anxiousness
09:13:10.680 and
09:13:11.398 intuition will
09:13:13.877 Solitude and reason compared to wildness
09:13:18.360 gregariousness and
09:13:20.360 Instinct stars and gods seem to have
09:13:23.278 profound effect can appear in the mind
09:13:25.800 as the Blood star can bring rot to
09:13:28.360 spread through your body can split your
09:13:30.680 mind and aspects of yourself in two how
09:13:33.960 much of the physical aspects of all this
09:13:36.360 eyes beasts bodies are really necessary
09:13:40.680 and instead just part and parcel to one
09:13:43.640 thing that has thought and emotion as
09:13:46.360 part of the essential foundations unlike
09:13:49.160 what is believed in our
09:13:51.519 world sorcery is a remarkable embodiment
09:13:54.960 of thoughts stars and fate to quote
09:13:57.960 Starlight even during the blackest
09:14:00.320 nights sojan underground or imprisonment
09:14:04.360 in jail the stars are never far from a
09:14:07.078 sorcerer's side note that here it is
09:14:10.278 Blackest Night not daylight it is more
09:14:13.557 about a lack of the senses being filled
09:14:16.078 than simply not seeing the Stars yet the
09:14:19.199 stars are not far from their sides if
09:14:22.040 the stars in the sky were were just the
09:14:23.519 visual component of a process that is
09:14:25.718 everywhere of which the events in the
09:14:27.800 lands between are part of are made of
09:14:30.917 the same way a wave in the ocean might
09:14:32.877 feel itself distinct but is part of many
09:14:36.122 all of whom part of a tide and so on an
09:14:39.199 enlightened sorcerer might realize that
09:14:41.122 the stars and their motions are within
09:14:43.438 them are part of the events that led to
09:14:46.040 this jail that the Primeval current
09:14:48.519 while it is hard to see in its pure form
09:14:51.040 is csing through everything everywhere
09:14:54.438 all the
09:14:55.800 time Stars themselves are referred to as
09:14:58.758 seemingly sentient not only do we find
09:15:01.360 some malform stars that are living but
09:15:03.758 radan challenges them as though it is a
09:15:05.877 fight with sentient beings just as he
09:15:08.278 might challenge Millenia the Sinners
09:15:11.040 Meet The Blood star it may be that some
09:15:14.000 outer gods are stars and they are just
09:15:16.122 not referenced to such interestingly
09:15:19.237 comets do not seem to be referenced in
09:15:21.160 the same way as being sent
09:15:24.040 nor do meteors it is as though they are
09:15:27.040 not the Mind aspect of space they seem
09:15:30.160 more like what we would expect in our
09:15:31.800 own world inanimate bodies yet they are
09:15:34.800 given great importance in the Eternal
09:15:38.000 cities we don't know exactly what is
09:15:40.278 going on but there is certainly some
09:15:42.278 convoluted influence from these Heavenly
09:15:44.680 Bodies even if they seem less alive from
09:15:47.758 item and spell
09:15:51.398 descriptions causality in Elden ring is
09:15:53.960 given to us in the law of causality
09:15:56.960 causality is the pull between meanings
09:15:59.438 it is the connections that form the
09:16:01.078 relationship of all things of all things
09:16:05.718 not simply the physical or one plane but
09:16:08.718 all things combined with the law of
09:16:11.480 regression that all things yearn
09:16:13.598 eternally to converge then we can begin
09:16:16.320 to see how witnessing something might
09:16:18.557 cause that thing to happen a new
09:16:21.078 relationship is created a deeper
09:16:23.557 relationship and there is Convergence
09:16:25.877 between thought and the real world
09:16:28.960 between perception and belief and
09:16:32.000 reality and between reality belief and
09:16:36.078 perception they go back and forth in all
09:16:38.877 orders all connected in Elden ring don't
09:16:42.557 merely be careful what you do be careful
09:16:45.199 what you see be careful what you think
09:16:48.320 because whether you will it or not it
09:16:50.360 may happen and the great Will May cause
09:16:53.360 a great deal to
09:16:56.199 happen sound is of course hugely
09:16:59.237 important to nelton Ray and has a great
09:17:01.718 power Spirit calling Bell shows some of
09:17:04.480 this in its own name when we use it it
09:17:07.320 does indeed use sound as part of the
09:17:09.398 method to call the spirit torrent 2 is
09:17:12.398 called by to some extent sound while it
09:17:16.040 is a magical device it is a bell a bell
09:17:19.557 we use to summon him from whatever plane
09:17:21.800 he resides does sound resonate across
09:17:25.199 Plains across thought dreams other
09:17:29.877 realities the realm of Body Spirit and
09:17:32.917 so on is it that the channels of the
09:17:35.438 senses Pierce through these but it is
09:17:38.000 hard to hear across them or perhaps it
09:17:40.960 takes Faith some memorable bells are the
09:17:43.758 large bells on the moving mums which is
09:17:46.557 rather interesting considering the
09:17:48.160 creatures house and protect soulless
09:17:51.078 demigods
09:17:52.877 what does our other Bell do call spirits
09:17:56.640 and the demigod has lost its Soul do
09:17:59.718 these mums travel the lands searching
09:18:02.360 endlessly for the possible location in
09:18:05.040 this plane or any other like layers of
09:18:08.000 firmaments in order to call the demigod
09:18:10.557 Spirit back to the body the same way we
09:18:13.278 call torrent the huge bell ringing
09:18:17.040 loudly the mosum ever searching to bring
09:18:20.438 the demigods Body and Soul together once
09:18:24.000 more and note if the senses are the
09:18:27.320 greatest portal to the soul or to these
09:18:29.839 deep Plains it is remarkable that the
09:18:32.839 head is missing sight sound taste smell
09:18:38.122 all but touch are lost and touch is the
09:18:41.398 most physical the most this world of all
09:18:44.839 the senses if we had to choose
09:18:47.237 one on death certain enemies drop Bell
09:18:50.718 bearings almost as if it is made made to
09:18:53.040 a fix to the inside of a bell to ring
09:18:55.320 with with its certain tone it will have
09:18:58.237 a certain call the bells even look as
09:19:01.519 personal and unique in texture as a
09:19:04.160 fingerprint a perfect identifier to call
09:19:06.839 in the perfect tone to the spirit of
09:19:09.160 whoever's Bell bearing it is sound seems
09:19:12.800 to be a remarkable call to the spirit
09:19:16.400 world we shouldn't forget taste
09:19:19.520 everything from rowa fruit for our
09:19:21.400 torrent to the boss like helping crab
09:19:23.720 meat flavor seems to be an important Aid
09:19:27.756 connoisseurs know how to keep from over
09:19:30.916 salting almost everything we eat in
09:19:33.120 Elden ring has an effect of course this
09:19:35.960 is a game this is typical but it is rare
09:19:38.720 that a game has such an in-depth and
09:19:41.000 varied network of food and drink based
09:19:43.400 systems when the focus of these games is
09:19:45.960 primarily on the
09:19:47.680 combat pickled items raw items mixed
09:19:52.080 items
09:19:53.480 affecting everything from Focus to even
09:19:56.520 life after death when it comes to
09:19:58.800 certain horrific rituals committed by
09:20:01.120 one who wishes to be an
09:20:03.160 omen given consumption has such a
09:20:05.840 profound effect in Elden ring taste is
09:20:08.480 the guide to its effect like in our
09:20:11.120 world it is a guide unlike our world
09:20:14.200 where the body effectively extracts and
09:20:16.960 fabricates what it needs in Elden ring
09:20:19.480 it seems that you become what you
09:20:21.480 consume in a much much more literal way
09:20:24.560 in our world the concept of eating bear
09:20:27.200 to become strong is viewed by most
09:20:29.240 modern science as absurd the nutrients
09:20:32.276 and energy in a bear may be of value and
09:20:34.960 will have this or that effect but
09:20:37.276 becoming bear like or gaining other
09:20:39.640 qualities like accuracy catching salmon
09:20:42.436 is
09:20:43.200 unlikely yet in Elden ring this is not
09:20:46.080 the case you literally seem to become
09:20:48.880 like what you consume or become robust
09:20:51.720 against that which you consume beasts
09:20:54.480 meat does make you strong like a beast
09:20:57.520 eating shelled creatures that have
09:20:59.480 strong defensive shells boosts your
09:21:02.080 resistance eating a dragon heart gives
09:21:04.720 you nature of a dragon taste therefore
09:21:08.320 may be a guide to much more what you
09:21:10.800 will become on eating this thing and
09:21:14.000 even more than that like other senses in
09:21:16.320 Elden rang it may have its own reality
09:21:19.120 and its own impact on reality just as
09:21:22.596 sight makes real the perception of taste
09:21:25.360 itself may give an effect on the body
09:21:28.160 the well salted crab kept from overs
09:21:30.520 salting May improve the taste and make
09:21:33.360 the effect as real as eating more of it
09:21:36.320 all the belief that it will work from
09:21:38.080 its very taste adds to its strength and
09:21:40.960 effect in this case if it was more than
09:21:43.840 Placebo or vastly stronger than Placebo
09:21:46.840 in Elden ring belief really has an
09:21:49.520 incredible effect on the world a chef
09:21:52.160 and a connoisseur would be highly valued
09:21:54.800 and if he had lived perhaps blackgard
09:21:57.240 big bogot could have been a buffing
09:21:59.400 snack Creator to
09:22:02.200 royalty touch is yet another sense that
09:22:04.840 seems to have a greater effect in game
09:22:06.916 than real life fear the deathbed
09:22:09.756 companion is of course an obvious
09:22:11.680 example of this she feels our warmth but
09:22:15.120 it has a real and tangible effect on her
09:22:17.960 and us it seems that she can bring
09:22:20.480 people back from the dead simply by
09:22:22.520 sharing her bodily warmth somehow life
09:22:25.800 passes across her into the dead body
09:22:28.436 allowing it to revive touch seems to
09:22:31.720 transmit the essence of life it can also
09:22:35.160 of course harm and kill fear's dress is
09:22:39.120 so soft so is not to harm even the most
09:22:42.080 withered
09:22:43.480 corpse touch can harm and this is its
09:22:46.800 great use during our playthrough
09:22:49.240 accepting a few light tricks and
09:22:51.320 perfumes the main sense we operate with
09:22:53.800 in Elden ring is touch and water touch
09:22:57.840 touch can certainly dictate fate it
09:23:00.276 seems as a sense yet it only goes so far
09:23:05.240 just as touch would remain on a headless
09:23:07.520 body the other senses would be removed
09:23:10.596 the inversion of this is that touch
09:23:12.480 seems to struggle to harm the soul we
09:23:15.880 ourselves revive torrent is unharmed
09:23:19.320 once slain but requires lifegiving
09:23:22.596 Vitality I.E energy for the physical
09:23:25.200 body and the examples go on and on other
09:23:29.400 measures seem to be needed to destroy
09:23:31.320 the soul and there are different methods
09:23:34.080 from Death birds and ghost flame to
09:23:36.880 special knives and black
09:23:39.160 Flames Rani who lightly controlled her
09:23:42.360 own death had only her body killed yet
09:23:45.880 the Assassins on the night of the black
09:23:47.596 knives kill Godwin's Soul even if
09:23:50.916 gameplay-wise it is not strictly adhered
09:23:53.400 to the blacksmith G says that he can
09:23:55.800 make us a weapon to kill a god Simple
09:23:59.040 Touch for soul or God killing is not a
09:24:01.916 sense that permeates enough to be
09:24:04.640 effective even Grace is described as
09:24:07.276 touching or not albor themselves live
09:24:10.756 Untouched by the Earth tree's Grace this
09:24:14.120 can be metaphorical but the glow we see
09:24:16.916 in certain eyes those who drop more
09:24:19.276 runes or the glow in Godfrey's eyes when
09:24:22.400 he is led by Grace seems to be a very
09:24:25.200 physical thing it may affect sight but
09:24:28.720 it seems right there at the point of
09:24:31.720 contact ghosts can disappear when we
09:24:34.360 touch them not from hearing us or seeing
09:24:37.520 us and the transformation of rigan's
09:24:39.880 body seems extremely physical and
09:24:42.800 tactile almost liquidlike as he is
09:24:45.720 submerged in touch of course in game as
09:24:50.000 in Life Touch creates sound which itself
09:24:53.320 can seem to communicate with other
09:24:55.276 planes sound is a downstream effect of
09:24:58.240 touch and has no existence without it
09:25:01.560 this is a good analogy for ourselves in
09:25:03.680 Elden ring Our Fate is dictated our
09:25:07.200 actions are predestined we would seem to
09:25:10.640 be like the sound to the touch of the
09:25:13.680 Stars it is hard to Define but these are
09:25:16.436 some attempts at analogies cause and
09:25:19.276 effect past present and future to do not
09:25:22.596 operate how they operate in our world or
09:25:25.080 at least how we think they operate and
09:25:27.640 the sense of their illusion in alen ring
09:25:29.640 is very
09:25:32.160 confusing and what about simply entering
09:25:34.880 the mind of others is this possible is
09:25:38.680 this how we enter fear's deathbed dream
09:25:41.200 that links to Godwin it seems the
09:25:44.040 greater will can enter the mind of
09:25:45.840 others if that is their method when we
09:25:48.120 see grace and perhaps when making BL
09:25:51.400 aggressive but can it be done otherwise
09:25:55.120 is this what Salis attempts with Rani
09:25:58.596 why is it again related to the Amber and
09:26:00.960 the Amber of the Stars to quote Amber
09:26:03.840 Starlight if the stars command our Fates
09:26:07.040 then Amber hued stars must command the
09:26:09.360 fates of the Gods such is the belief
09:26:12.080 that inspired the use of these shards to
09:26:14.240 prepare a most special
09:26:16.720 draft remember that what is thought to
09:26:19.200 be the founding glint Stone sorcery
09:26:21.520 founding rain of stars was set off by an
09:26:24.320 astrologer glimpsing the Primeval
09:26:26.320 current which made it real and the Stars
09:26:29.080 Amber rained down on this land so
09:26:32.240 perception can make things real Amber is
09:26:35.160 related to these stars and seems to be
09:26:37.596 in some way related to
09:26:39.916 Fortune the Amber draft says give it to
09:26:43.276 Ronnie and ensure she drinks it and
09:26:45.960 we'll be in a position to claim the very
09:26:48.360 finest puppet ever
09:26:50.436 crafted so Stars and Amber are
09:26:53.000 incredibly connected to the Future and
09:26:56.080 fate we have seen that in a way one
09:26:59.120 cannot Escape fate even Rony cannot
09:27:01.960 progress when fate is stalled if one
09:27:04.880 stops fighting and wears a blindfold one
09:27:08.000 might meet the path of your fate or the
09:27:10.720 star of your fate even sooner and what
09:27:13.880 if the fate or that which guides fate
09:27:16.840 could be controlled itself or you hold
09:27:20.000 the history or the past of what controls
09:27:22.916 the future in the path traced by the
09:27:25.800 Star by whatever the mechanism and it is
09:27:29.160 confusing it seems as though if fate is
09:27:31.840 not only stalled but fully controlled
09:27:35.000 then just as there was no need for Sight
09:27:37.680 there is no need for movement or will of
09:27:40.960 any kind if total abandon is given up to
09:27:44.680 fate or every aspect of your future is
09:27:47.800 controlled the will has no more place it
09:27:51.520 cannot change anything however strong it
09:27:53.680 is hence the person becomes a puppet in
09:27:57.040 this state their future is bound up
09:28:00.596 totally every action or
09:28:03.560 word this is Theory as it was never
09:28:06.436 achieved in game so we don't know how it
09:28:09.000 works but how it works is more about
09:28:12.000 time and causality past present future
09:28:16.080 than some sort of mind control which is
09:28:18.800 what first comes to mind when we think
09:28:20.916 of making someone a
09:28:23.160 puppet in the playthrough Ronnie risks
09:28:26.080 several things not having a fate or
09:28:29.120 having it stalled she couldn't use the
09:28:31.080 Finger Slayer blade to harm the greater
09:28:32.916 will and its vassels because the blade
09:28:35.560 cannot be wielded by those without her
09:28:37.680 fate yet she also though she doesn't
09:28:40.640 know of sal' plans risks having a
09:28:43.720 totally rigid fate controlled by
09:28:46.800 Salis all of this of course is set upon
09:28:49.880 the backdrop that all the sense St
09:28:52.800 and sense of interacting in the lands
09:28:54.916 between May simply be a Grand Illusion
09:28:58.120 or at best extra non-consequential
09:29:01.240 actions that happened amongst a chain of
09:29:03.560 cause and effect that is an unavoidable
09:29:06.596 fate Ronnie would have no free will in
09:29:09.480 this case puppet or free it would just
09:29:12.560 be that the decisions of how this fate
09:29:14.960 plays out changes depending on Whose
09:29:17.436 hands it is in but whose hands is the
09:29:20.320 puppeteers fate in
09:29:23.520 from software's Inspirations are of
09:29:25.800 course Very diverse from fantasy
09:29:29.596 mythology Alchemy
09:29:32.360 religion here in this video we've looked
09:29:35.000 at some strong possible Inspirations the
09:29:37.720 science of the observation and
09:29:39.720 interaction of the very small in our
09:29:42.000 world and the capacity for thought and
09:29:44.560 belief to have a real impact on the
09:29:46.680 world something observed in personal
09:29:49.400 experience and in the placebo effect in
09:29:51.680 me for hundreds of years who knows
09:29:55.360 perhaps Miaki is a believer in certain
09:29:57.756 self-help books or holds a metaphysical
09:30:00.916 belief that thoughts come before reality
09:30:04.480 one might say his career hasn't
09:30:06.160 disproven this if it is what he
09:30:09.080 believes certainly Elden ring operates
09:30:11.916 in some quite different ways and we are
09:30:14.756 just beginning to wrap our minds around
09:30:17.000 it

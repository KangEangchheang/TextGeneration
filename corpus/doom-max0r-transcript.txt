00:00:25.840 doom eternal is a game with so much
00:00:28.080 testosterone dripping from its orifices
00:00:30.080 that it caused me to create a sun via
00:00:32.000 mitosis
00:00:32.800 in this adventure you play as john doom
00:00:35.280 a man stricken with irrationally severe
00:00:37.440 autism who does not consider or think
00:00:39.520 through his actions and effects on other
00:00:41.360 people and
00:00:42.160 in his quest to save mankind kills god
00:00:45.120 god god and
00:00:46.239 satan god god who is also himself if
00:00:49.120 this
00:00:49.440 in-depth and engaging hardcore male
00:00:51.440 gameplay sounds appealing then i've got
00:00:53.199 the game for you
00:00:54.399 this game is of course the sequel to the
00:00:56.160 critically acclaimed doom 2016 with a
00:00:58.640 few key differences
00:01:00.160 all right then buddy i'm going to
00:01:03.600 [ __ ] yourself which meaningfully extends
00:01:06.640 and builds off of the gameplay and
00:01:08.240 challenges that we love
00:01:09.520 then extends them some more off of a
00:01:11.360 [ __ ] clip until the product that
00:01:13.040 emerges out the other side resembles
00:01:14.640 crack concentrate
00:01:15.759 if you're watching this i'm assuming
00:01:17.200 you've probably played the game since i
00:01:18.880 don't actually want to help people buy
00:01:20.799 things
00:01:21.200 i'm here to entertain people and if
00:01:22.880 you're clamoring for entertainment and
00:01:24.640 haven't purchased this game yet
00:01:26.159 do yourself a favor there's enough male
00:01:28.080 hormones here to transition someone and
00:01:30.320 i can
00:01:30.799 guarantee you results my fellow sigma
00:01:33.119 males so whether you're a psychopath
00:01:35.040 like me or new to modern doom games come
00:01:37.439 with me on this amazing journey through
00:01:39.200 twitch gameplay
00:01:40.240 beautiful environments nonsensically
00:01:42.320 [ __ ] up lore and
00:01:43.439 remixed mongolian throat singing for
00:01:45.439 money is temporary
00:01:46.799 but doom is eternal
00:01:54.079 i would say that do maternal's gameplay
00:01:55.759 is quite unique and not for the reasons
00:01:57.680 that you would think
00:01:58.560 everything in do maternal is funneled
00:02:00.159 directly into a single robust
00:02:02.000 multifaceted multinational and
00:02:04.079 unilaterally combat system from which
00:02:06.159 the entire game is built around but
00:02:08.000 maxor i hear you thinking that's every
00:02:10.160 game ever yes
00:02:11.599 every good game ever if i for instance
00:02:14.000 became 12 and booted up gta 5
00:02:16.400 i would be able to do at least a dozen
00:02:18.560 unfun activities
00:02:19.840 doom's design is focused harder than the
00:02:21.599 average persona fan on his local
00:02:23.280 playground
00:02:24.000 and that is special you will play the
00:02:26.160 game in the way that is fun or you will
00:02:28.000 lose
00:02:28.400 so as good as 2016 was a polygon
00:02:30.879 journalist could beat the first half and
00:02:32.640 that's unacceptable because yes it is
00:02:34.720 actually unfun to play games after
00:02:36.400 having a lobotomy
00:02:37.360 in other games i get to choose between
00:02:39.200 things like stealth vehicles or outright
00:02:41.280 combat yet do maternal asks the question
00:02:43.599 why not force you to use every mechanic
00:02:45.920 all the time
00:02:46.720 without stopping in a world where aaa
00:02:48.879 studios try to pander to everyone it's
00:02:50.800 refreshing to have a game that sets out
00:02:52.480 to do one thing
00:02:53.519 the best and actually have developers
00:02:55.280 who give a [ __ ] about linear design and
00:02:57.360 gameplay
00:02:57.920 and the main component of that gameplay
00:02:59.760 is the arsenal because
00:03:01.120 john doom uses every weapon throughout
00:03:03.040 the game the first shotgun is used in
00:03:04.879 the last level and the last level is
00:03:06.720 used by the first shotgun when you get
00:03:08.560 an upgrade it isn't a replacement it's a
00:03:10.480 genuine addition to your arsenal
00:03:12.080 every one of them has specific uses and
00:03:13.840 yet these don't interfere at all
00:03:15.519 they enhance how do i kill an enemy well
00:03:18.159 shoot his hands off fire a rocket fire a
00:03:20.080 ballista fire flame freeze
00:03:21.519 fire fire on his freeze and throw
00:03:23.120 shotgun shotgun brain aneurysm just as
00:03:25.440 important as how you kill is how you
00:03:27.120 heal and how you restore
00:03:28.560 fortunately the aggression of this game
00:03:30.000 rivals my dog in a kindergarten like
00:03:31.840 real life the only way to get ahead of
00:03:33.360 the competition is to kill them how do i
00:03:35.360 heal when low
00:03:36.239 kill them how do i get ammo back kill
00:03:38.319 them with a chainsaw
00:03:39.680 in addition most weapons in the game
00:03:41.440 have two mods which completely change
00:03:43.120 their behavior
00:03:43.760 such stunning examples would be the
00:03:45.519 microwave beam the automatic shotgun and
00:03:47.760 the [ __ ] destroyer blade god that
00:03:49.360 shit's cool but on top of eight weapons
00:03:50.959 12 mods and a declining mental state we
00:03:53.200 keep going more than any one weapon
00:03:54.879 you'll be using your suit abilities and
00:03:56.480 they all have individual buttons
00:03:58.159 this is in addition to the eight that
00:03:59.519 you use for weapons these would be
00:04:01.040 things like zoom for fast grenade for
00:04:02.959 death swedish grenade for life punch for
00:04:05.040 no reason
00:04:05.599 and a flamethrower for armor i play
00:04:07.360 invoker and dota 2 and this [ __ ] makes
00:04:08.879 me play my keyboard like it's a [ __ ]
00:04:10.319 moonlight sonata i thoroughly recommend
00:04:12.159 playing pc and never using the weapon
00:04:13.920 wheel for maximal ritalin output and if
00:04:15.840 you can't switch weapons fast or play on
00:04:17.519 easy mode
00:04:18.399 that's fine man we're all busy how about
00:04:19.918 i give you two more buttons you thought
00:04:21.759 i was done
00:04:22.400 there's two ways to kill a demon and do
00:04:24.160 maternal the fun way or the funny way
00:04:26.560 and to maximize the funniness level we
00:04:28.800 have the crucible which is a direct
00:04:30.800 instantaneous kill on every enemy giant
00:04:33.600 area boss
00:04:34.400 dead previous area boss dead the final
00:04:37.360 boss
00:04:37.840 [ __ ] up now i hear you thinking josh
00:04:40.000 that sounds pretty strong
00:04:41.440 oh boy buckle your ass because the
00:04:43.680 second super weapon on my extensive list
00:04:45.600 of two things is the bfg
00:04:47.520 which canonically stands for big [ __ ]
00:04:50.080 gun also canonically it fires a hole
00:04:52.400 directly into the core
00:04:53.680 of mars you can't
00:05:00.479 now i could kill an enemy the long way
00:05:02.560 or i could kill him
00:05:03.840 and his dog faster than the atf at waco
00:05:06.160 it clears out everything you can see
00:05:08.080 instantly i am so thankful the game
00:05:09.919 limits how many times you can do this
00:05:11.440 now i understand that at first this may
00:05:13.120 seem
00:05:13.600 complicated but that just isn't true
00:05:15.280 because the entire game is
00:05:16.639 effectively a tutorial for hard mode and
00:05:18.720 because you're always learning as you
00:05:20.000 play it never feels stale
00:05:21.520 doom even lets you choose what stats and
00:05:23.360 runes to upgrade i spec
00:05:24.880 entirely into mobility and ammo making
00:05:27.360 my character a flimsy crack addled
00:05:29.360 spider monkey
00:05:30.240 as a side note we should release dozens
00:05:32.240 or possibly hundreds of macaques into
00:05:34.000 new york city
00:05:34.800 they can survive there why does thailand
00:05:37.039 get to keep all of the good monkeys so
00:05:38.800 what more is there to learn about doom
00:05:40.560 eternal well have you ever given thought
00:05:42.639 to the various unwashed baboons that i'm
00:05:44.720 fighting the answer
00:05:45.680 may shock you those are the others as
00:05:48.479 you may have guessed
00:05:49.280 there are at least three perhaps four
00:05:51.520 demons in the game which is a lot for
00:05:53.199 someone who is a small
00:05:54.400 blonde anime lolly such as myself but
00:05:56.720 it's the variety of the demons that make
00:05:58.319 the game interesting demons can fly they
00:06:00.560 can roll around like hedgehogs contract
00:06:02.400 obesity and be bastards who is sandy
00:06:05.039 lope
00:06:05.440 who is tsushima amy rose i didn't know
00:06:08.400 she could stand
00:06:09.440 the point of the entire game therefore
00:06:11.120 is to balance targets switch weapons and
00:06:13.039 scream internally as you repeatedly fail
00:06:15.039 to be cool just like high school what
00:06:16.800 i'm getting at is every game that has
00:06:18.240 completely different behavior and goals
00:06:19.919 from one another the doom hunter rolls
00:06:21.600 around in a comically small
00:06:23.199 tank the zombies like us exist to die
00:06:25.919 and the marauder produces controversy he
00:06:28.400 does a lot of damage blocks your attacks
00:06:30.240 fights you at wild speeds and can only
00:06:32.160 be attacked after blatantly signaling so
00:06:34.319 i personally have no issue with him as i
00:06:36.080 find the challenge fun and engaging and
00:06:38.000 if you don't i'm not saying you're wrong
00:06:39.759 i'm saying you're bad i'm not getting
00:06:41.360 into the details for each one
00:06:42.720 since that's not funny but don't worry
00:06:44.639 there are 27 of them
00:06:46.240 without dlc and if you're wondering why
00:06:48.400 i'm fighting the entire cast of dante's
00:06:50.319 inferno you're actually
00:06:51.599 the minority this game tries at every
00:06:53.360 moment to make exposition
00:06:54.639 collectible why is there just a [ __ ]
00:06:56.960 big spear in the planet and why is
00:06:58.720 heaven comprised entirely of moth people
00:07:01.039 you cannot stop the procession
00:07:05.280 it feels like one guy wrote the events
00:07:06.960 of the game and another guy invented lsd
00:07:09.280 just to write the backstory so i'm going
00:07:11.039 to combine both of them into a single
00:07:12.960 accurate interpretation of the doom lore
00:07:15.120 if i say something
00:07:16.000 objectionable just pretend that it's
00:07:17.759 right
00:07:24.720 one brazilian years ago there was a guy
00:07:26.800 named the dad who was effectively god
00:07:28.880 and he made moths in lamp heaven called
00:07:30.880 the makers
00:07:31.520 every ten thousand years all moths
00:07:33.360 combine their collective consciousness
00:07:34.960 into one
00:07:35.599 giga moth called the con maker who is
00:07:37.759 the moth pope so the moths rule over the
00:07:39.599 galaxy sort of until earth happens and
00:07:41.520 then we start [ __ ] everything up
00:07:42.960 the moth pope finds john doom after a
00:07:44.800 spree of murders and he explains to her
00:07:46.479 that yes
00:07:47.120 hell exists it's weird that humans knew
00:07:49.280 about hell before god
00:07:50.720 anyways the moth pope after finding out
00:07:52.479 that hell is real very reasonably
00:07:54.160 decides to sacrifice a planet to it see
00:07:56.479 it turns out that god literally pieced
00:07:58.400 the [ __ ] out like 10 million years ago
00:08:00.319 and let them off do whatever they wanted
00:08:01.840 so now the con maker cannot be replaced
00:08:03.840 and cannot die so she sort of goes
00:08:05.360 insane from the constant immortality now
00:08:07.199 the plan is to get some of that sweet
00:08:08.800 hell energy by repeatedly sacrificing
00:08:10.720 entire planets to the dark lord in
00:08:12.560 exchange for it meanwhile a sentient
00:08:14.479 robot named samuel hayden is very busy
00:08:16.720 on mars
00:08:17.360 earth has this problem called climate
00:08:18.960 change and we need to find a new energy
00:08:20.720 source so instead of something hard and
00:08:22.639 difficult like
00:08:23.440 solar power samuel hayden is like what
00:08:25.280 if we extract this cool
00:08:26.639 blue energy from hell also it's on mars
00:08:31.120 earth does this until hell begins
00:08:32.719 breaking into mars and john doom stops
00:08:34.719 them which is the plot of doom 2016.
00:08:36.719 this makes samuel hayden mad because
00:08:38.399 he's funded by the koch brothers and
00:08:39.919 really doesn't want to build a windmill
00:08:41.519 so instead of destroying the demonic
00:08:43.039 crucible he just brings it back to earth
00:08:44.720 and catapults john doom into the
00:08:46.160 backstory planet if you think that
00:08:47.760 sounds unreasonable just remember that
00:08:49.440 we considered blotting out the sun
00:08:50.959 before building a [ __ ] solar panel
00:08:57.600 unsurprisingly demons invade to recycle
00:09:00.000 earth into blue energy for the moth pope
00:09:01.920 so john doom has to fight both catholics
00:09:04.160 and hell and as you go through the game
00:09:06.000 you might notice that it just brings up
00:09:07.519 random [ __ ] at will
00:09:08.640 like oh sorry the soul factory is being
00:09:10.800 held there by two gigantic titans and
00:09:12.800 it's like
00:09:13.200 okay i guess attack on titan is real now
00:09:15.760 doomslayer you'll need this knife to
00:09:17.440 kill my son oh [ __ ] what do you do
00:09:21.360 the plot of the main game to understate
00:09:23.360 it is psychotic
00:09:24.480 and acts as an increasing checklist of
00:09:26.320 galactically convoluted tasks just in
00:09:28.560 this one game
00:09:29.440 john doom finds an ancient city like
00:09:31.360 three times goes to the north pole to
00:09:33.279 kill santa
00:09:34.160 fights croatia does a little trolling
00:09:36.399 does a little [ __ ] fighting
00:09:37.920 invades heaven and permanently kills god
00:09:40.560 but we'll get back to that doom 2016
00:09:42.560 took place on mars but this game has you
00:09:44.720 slung around the universe on a [ __ ]
00:09:46.399 bungee cord so i understand completely
00:09:48.399 when people say they don't play doom
00:09:49.920 eternal for the plot they're just wrong
00:09:51.920 i play doom eternal for the plot and
00:09:54.080 that might sound strange to you but
00:09:55.680 eternal's plot is
00:09:56.800 pure insanity and it does everything
00:09:58.560 that it needs to we are painfully aware
00:10:00.640 that the plot exists as a contrivance
00:10:02.399 because the environmental designer went
00:10:04.000 [ __ ] ballistic i just don't care i
00:10:05.920 played every single level gleefully
00:10:07.760 wondering
00:10:08.320 oh boy what stupid [ __ ] is next i cannot
00:10:10.959 [ __ ] wait
00:10:11.760 so play the game for the plot it is
00:10:13.920 integral to the experience of doom
00:10:15.519 eternal
00:10:16.000 open max or there's a plot hole how did
00:10:17.839 the doom slayer get the first
00:10:19.279 everything i've said so far except some
00:10:21.120 of it applies in full partially to the
00:10:23.040 base game but there's
00:10:24.160 40 dollar reduce of dlc where the
00:10:26.240 gameplay is faster the challenge harder
00:10:28.480 and the plot
00:10:29.200 somehow even [ __ ] worse in all the
00:10:31.120 right departments 2016 was a walk
00:10:33.279 eternal is usain bolt and the ancient
00:10:35.279 gods is [ __ ] venezuelan inflation you
00:10:37.360 thought it was over when john doom beat
00:10:39.040 the demons and destroyed all of heaven
00:10:40.720 but you were wrong
00:10:41.760 that's just the beginning and with both
00:10:43.519 parts of the dlc now fully out my
00:10:45.600 recommendation cannot be understated
00:10:47.360 let's get into why and more importantly
00:10:49.519 what
00:10:55.360 this section of the video is going to be
00:10:57.040 different far more structural and
00:10:58.480 aligned with the plot of the dlc
00:11:00.160 because the gameplay isn't what's new
00:11:01.680 about the product it's the challenge and
00:11:03.279 the story i originally wrote an entire
00:11:05.200 script for this and then trashed it
00:11:06.640 because it doesn't truly communicate how
00:11:08.320 this dlc drove me to insanity and i hard
00:11:10.640 cope by simping for 2d women i will tell
00:11:12.560 you if there's a very big gameplay
00:11:14.000 change but the point of the dlc is more
00:11:15.920 of what's amazing if you like doom a
00:11:17.519 turtle you will like the dlc
00:11:19.360 period okay so samuel hayden you might
00:11:21.440 know him for his various appearances on
00:11:22.959 political youtube debates advocating for
00:11:24.800 carbon positivity it turns out that he's
00:11:27.040 not a robot he's a [ __ ] angel also
00:11:29.519 john dooms alexa is god that's not a
00:11:31.680 joke or exaggeration his name is vega
00:11:33.760 and he is the physical remnant of god's
00:11:35.839 consciousness in ai form so samuel now a
00:11:38.480 [ __ ] divine being wants you to revive
00:11:40.560 him since both god and satan are trapped
00:11:42.959 in volleyballs
00:11:43.839 at this point the video can't count as
00:11:45.360 spoilers because it makes no [ __ ]
00:11:47.040 sense
00:11:47.440 the first dlc is essentially trolling
00:11:49.360 because you kill god
00:11:50.800 why well obviously to revive satan
00:11:53.440 exclusively so you can fight him what
00:11:55.279 could go
00:11:55.680 wrong a particular note here on the
00:11:57.600 gameplay side is the final boss who is
00:11:59.839 samuel hayden because holy [ __ ] this
00:12:01.920 fight is hard also the premise is
00:12:03.519 ridiculous and my enjoyment of the game
00:12:05.120 is hurt by neither every aspect of this
00:12:07.040 is speedy
00:12:07.760 fun and everything else i've already
00:12:09.519 said about the game in general and when
00:12:11.200 you finally beat samuel and revive the
00:12:12.959 dark lord it
00:12:13.839 turns out he's you yeah the only thing
00:12:17.360 in the world that could possibly kill
00:12:19.120 john doom
00:12:22.839 himself
00:12:33.920 so now the not you you decides to go to
00:12:36.079 hell where we all belong and the second
00:12:37.760 dlc is just chasing him this is of
00:12:39.600 course where the testosterone moves into
00:12:41.279 critical levels
00:12:42.160 how does one get to the capital city of
00:12:44.079 hell well that's a great question first
00:12:46.000 of all go to the planet of argentineur
00:12:48.320 light the bat signal learn how to train
00:12:50.399 your dragon okay go into the giant spear
00:12:52.800 that pierces the entire planet for some
00:12:54.639 reason get the key to the gate
00:12:56.959 now go back to earth traverse the last
00:12:58.800 of us two and find the gate of diluma
00:13:00.880 but before i get to the final showdown
00:13:02.480 with crash bandicoot twinsanity there's
00:13:04.480 some cool gameplay i want to talk
00:13:06.000 about you have a [ __ ] hammer in this
00:13:07.680 dlc primarily used to defy the laws of
00:13:09.839 gravity but secondarily gives you
00:13:11.519 everything in the game
00:13:12.480 health no problem ammo absolutely my
00:13:15.279 deepest darkest urges
00:13:16.720 yes as i used this i became more
00:13:18.560 obsessed with hammers than bob the
00:13:19.920 [ __ ] builder and there's plenty of
00:13:21.440 demons to use it on since the dlc has a
00:13:23.600 shitload of reskins for instance the
00:13:25.519 spirit is a congealed amphetamine mass
00:13:27.519 that makes every infested target three
00:13:29.040 times faster microsoft pinball who is
00:13:31.279 fun to fight i promise
00:13:32.639 and the blood makers they are my
00:13:35.600 original
00:13:36.320 oc do not steal it so now that we've
00:13:38.880 reached cleveland it's time for the dlc
00:13:40.800 to gain
00:13:41.440 style this is the culmination of all of
00:13:43.839 our work the final battle against satan
00:13:46.000 himself
00:13:46.720 and holy [ __ ] you can feel it when the
00:13:48.800 sentinel army shows up and everyone's
00:13:50.399 ready to kick ass you just can't help
00:13:51.920 but feel like your dick is being tickled
00:13:53.440 cleveland lives up to the hype too
00:13:55.040 for once because it's a non-stop battle
00:13:56.959 of epic proportions right up until the
00:13:58.639 final boss
00:13:59.440 this is a universe which implicitly
00:14:01.199 acknowledges your god-like power by
00:14:02.959 making the only credible threat to you
00:14:04.880 your identical twin with red eyes in a
00:14:07.040 gun though that is called [ __ ]
00:14:08.560 gameplay and it's a beautiful send-off
00:14:10.480 right up until the man himself who
00:14:12.000 awkwardly waddles around the arena like
00:14:13.760 a penguin but that's fine the fight is
00:14:15.440 still cool
00:14:18.639 wow you know it's so sad that steve jobs
00:14:20.720 died with pigma who the hell is steve
00:14:23.199 jobs got him
00:14:27.600 now before we defenestrate there's a few
00:14:29.600 details i want to talk about that truly
00:14:31.440 complete this game make it a real 10 out
00:14:33.199 of good
00:14:33.680 firstly i would classify the music of
00:14:35.440 this game as metal without guitars and i
00:14:37.920 [ __ ] dig it
00:14:38.880 so much how do you make metal without a
00:14:40.560 guitar well you sample mongolian throat
00:14:42.639 singing and your lawnmower
00:14:45.839 it just sounds so good normally music
00:14:48.000 isn't very important but
00:14:49.360 it's so good that it becomes important
00:14:51.279 and the role it plays in setting your
00:14:52.639 mood is vital also the main composer
00:14:54.880 mick gordon like v
00:14:56.320 watches virtual youtubers every waking
00:14:58.320 second of his day great minds think
00:15:00.000 alike
00:15:00.480 in fact most of the music in this video
00:15:02.399 is just do maternal soundtrack guess
00:15:04.160 you'll have to re-watch it over and over
00:15:06.000 again to really listen
00:15:13.440 finally this game looks really good not
00:15:15.600 in the oh wow look at all these
00:15:16.959 particles i'm stroking out way
00:15:18.639 it's more like how does literally anyone
00:15:20.399 have time to model all of the geometry
00:15:22.160 in the game it is unreal
00:15:23.279 it is so downright inspired that it
00:15:25.040 makes you feel bad while playing it doom
00:15:26.880 eternal is such a fast and
00:15:28.160 pulse-pounding game that it's like
00:15:29.440 sprinting through the [ __ ] lube
00:15:30.880 how am i supposed to appreciate the mona
00:15:32.399 lisa when it looks like this should you
00:15:34.160 buy the game yes
00:15:35.199 i am very biased if speed and action is
00:15:37.360 what you crave and you want to induce
00:15:38.880 cardiac arrest early
00:15:40.079 this is your game i would like to thank
00:15:41.680 the demonic brotherhood funding this
00:15:43.199 channel in exchange for their souls
00:15:44.880 if you would like to engage in blood
00:15:46.480 sacrifice on my behalf

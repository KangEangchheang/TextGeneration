00:00:05.240 caledia Altus laying down
00:00:08.420 whatever this place is
00:00:11.179 these places and many more in the lands
00:00:13.440 between were once ruled by the great
00:00:14.880 Queen America
00:00:17.100 before the world's messiest divorce now
00:00:19.740 America's treasure source of all her
00:00:21.779 power languages in the hands of the
00:00:23.580 demigods waiting to be claimed only by
00:00:26.039 the strongest of Champions
00:00:28.439 but that's kind of hard this promise
00:00:30.359 drove countless Tardis to the earned
00:00:32.159 Tree in pursuit of Horrors more
00:00:33.600 terrifying than they could dare to
00:00:34.980 imagine these Journeys are the pursuit
00:00:36.780 of that treasure the great Elden rigs
00:01:06.330 [Music]
00:01:11.240 last time on Elgin ring Our Heroes
00:01:14.700 emerged to find a world in Ruins and a
00:01:16.680 throne unclaimed alone they braved
00:01:18.659 godric the graphics funny bouncy castle
00:01:20.400 to perform some prosthetic surgery
00:01:22.200 enrolled in Raya University with a major
00:01:24.420 in Family Medicine challenge the great
00:01:26.700 hero rodon in a pitched battle to
00:01:28.500 vaporize the Eastern Seaboard of nothing
00:01:30.180 of value was lost that day descended
00:01:32.100 into Friedrich Fazbear's Mega Pizza Plex
00:01:33.960 and introduced him to the bullet of 45
00:01:35.579 and finally entered the golden capital
00:01:37.860 of Langdale to claim the Elden throw
00:01:40.820 I [ __ ] hate Ikea but that's all the
00:01:43.680 past now edge up you don't have to view
00:01:45.360 it my audio sounded like it was in a
00:01:47.040 bathroom scene so all you need to know
00:01:48.659 is up the skid row is [ __ ] up here is
00:01:50.880 the plan to enter the archery we're
00:01:52.619 going to need more Firepower than
00:01:53.820 American resets and that is where the
00:01:55.680 mountain of death and destruction and
00:01:57.119 [ __ ] comes in compared to California I
00:01:59.159 would say this is an improvement to
00:02:00.479 reach these high peaks and mountainous
00:02:01.979 menageries our heroes must escape
00:02:03.540 California and brave The Forbidden lands
00:02:05.820 which is a task easier said than done
00:02:08.399 hey guys Max over here welcome to
00:02:10.619 Welcome to the Luma key Dimension I can
00:02:12.540 overlay anything out of the screen the
00:02:14.220 [ __ ] build their boss fight inside
00:02:15.300 Patrick Stewart Cube so we head into the
00:02:17.099 cleverly disguised hallway and the only
00:02:18.900 major problem we encounter is that the
00:02:20.160 enemies are up uh
00:02:22.160 as an empath I can sense that it that
00:02:25.200 it's cold you know what I think it's
00:02:26.580 time that we uh we uh
00:02:34.520 yeah this is definitely not
00:02:36.180 foreshadowing anything
00:02:39.180 [Music]
00:02:44.220 welcome to the funny Mountain where the
00:02:46.560 difficulty spikes harder than the
00:02:47.640 elevation like geologically how does
00:02:49.500 this happen you know you can tell it's
00:02:50.819 going to be a great area when the first
00:02:52.140 NPC you meet is absolutely officeworks
00:02:54.300 wow dude you're just like Sonic the
00:02:56.519 Hedgehog I'm I'm fantastic at writing
00:02:58.440 jokes so we're here in the the
00:03:00.500 oh my God this mountain is so beautiful
00:03:03.780 it makes me want to dive into it and
00:03:05.879 stay there forever Once Upon a Time
00:03:07.680 these mountains were an ancient
00:03:09.239 Battleground where Giants dwelled among
00:03:11.159 men now it's a modern Battleground where
00:03:13.080 ketamine dwells inside my blood you know
00:03:14.760 this place looks really nice but uh what
00:03:16.560 did Mr Krabs do to Jellyfish Fields this
00:03:18.480 is not how I Imagine Dragons Radioactive
00:03:22.080 well on board of this place it's just
00:03:24.000 missing that little bit of variety to
00:03:25.739 the gameplay you know with its three
00:03:27.480 dungeons but because from soft package
00:03:29.400 their game with the ability to uh to do
00:03:31.140 this he's so beautiful we're going to be
00:03:33.480 using this amazing mechanic to talk to
00:03:35.640 you about energy drinks that's right
00:03:37.800 gamer Subs made the mistake of
00:03:39.239 sponsoring me and they said yes you can
00:03:41.340 make Elton ring builds based on our
00:03:42.659 flavors this is a decision I will make
00:03:44.459 them regret alright first on our list is
00:03:46.200 a blowhole blast she looks very sad
00:03:49.019 today I can think of a pretty
00:03:50.700 appropriate weapon for this build
00:03:51.900 honestly emotional damage damages you
00:03:54.360 with the how he [ __ ] was titty milk
00:03:57.060 why would you do this lots of strength
00:03:59.400 on this guy he was stung by a bee
00:04:01.379 guacamole gamer fart 9000 got a got a
00:04:04.680 big Schnauzer on this one gonna be doing
00:04:06.360 an Arcane poison build it really
00:04:08.519 accentuates the flavor my favorite one
00:04:10.319 is definitely a code maxor with the zero
00:04:12.420 for free shipping on gamer sub samples
00:04:14.400 he gets to try energy drinks for free
00:04:16.260 using the link in the description or he
00:04:18.358 can use the code for 10 off gamer Subs
00:04:20.339 purchases if he is watching the video

00:04:27.900 somewhere my sink is so goddamn
00:04:29.520 energized right now the [ __ ] that's a
00:04:32.699 that's a big skeleton I'm sure it's not
00:04:34.139 indicative of any of other video games
00:04:36.060 we Avenger the [ __ ] calcium Carnival
00:04:38.220 this part of the game is very humorous
00:04:44.520 oh

00:04:49.560 I got a cool plan for this guy it's time
00:04:51.240 to put those wings to the goddamn test
00:04:53.190 [Music]
00:04:55.280 I I genuinely didn't know if that was
00:04:57.660 possible the bailiff whack his boss on
00:04:59.940 The Far Side of the Mountain there's
00:05:01.199 this uh funny Castle I think I think
00:05:04.259 Miyazaki put these here to torture me
00:05:05.759 this is the part of the game that gets
00:05:07.139 offended when you take damage and there
00:05:08.699 is a lot of damage to be taken my
00:05:10.800 favorite is the other the 13th annual
00:05:12.419 ghost convention very up very packed
00:05:14.520 venue we've got today is doing some
00:05:15.960 school but I'm taking you to the shelter

00:05:45.600 than God

00:06:38.400 the mountain and face the fire giant
00:06:41.580 wait a [ __ ] second I wasn't listening
00:06:44.100 to the exposition
00:06:50.360 so this is John Cena I called that
00:06:53.160 because you can't [ __ ] see him I
00:06:54.780 think they might have made him not a
00:06:56.340 little too big we're gonna we're gonna
00:06:57.720 have to fight him on his own turn oh
00:06:59.100 hell yeah dude let's go fight let's go

00:07:09.419 feet so to beat this boss I'm going to
00:07:11.160 have to use my secret ability called
00:07:12.479 post cognition which allows me to
00:07:14.340 interpret events that have already
00:07:15.419 happened hmm it appears that I should
00:07:17.400 have dodged that unfortunately this boss
00:07:19.199 has a weakness it's called playing a
00:07:21.180 mage build the shadow wizard Money Gang
00:07:22.979 we love casting some helps but for the
00:07:24.780 rest of us we have to attack this really

00:12:54.899 a land of many Mysteries Mysteries such
00:12:56.820 as why
00:12:58.380 God but to access the greatest mystery
00:13:00.779 of them all we're going to need to do
00:13:02.100 something
00:13:03.600 platforming making our way down the fun
00:13:05.639 gameplay we reach a random divot in the
00:13:07.560 ground which we're supposed to happen
00:13:11.279 this prompts us to have a crazy [ __ ]
00:13:13.440 dream
00:13:15.600 what the [ __ ] I dream of what could have
00:13:18.360 been if I didn't smoke crack then the
00:13:21.000 storm expands to consume my Earthly
00:13:22.920 flesh like
00:13:28.820 [ __ ] I was hoping that would kill me
00:13:35.459 I how's the weather up there
00:13:43.320 welcome everyone to the most diabetic
00:13:45.720 boss in the game he's a not really big
00:13:47.519 in the whole movement thing so instead
00:13:49.980 of killing you directly dragonlord
00:13:51.360 parthenex screams at God to kill you
00:13:53.220 instead what a coincidence I also scream
00:13:55.440 at God to kill me this is like a half of
00:13:57.480 his attacks and if you're wondering what
00:13:58.860 the other half is it's uh it's it's just
00:14:01.920 this come on man I don't even look like
00:14:03.899 a sink this boss hit me so hard that uh
00:14:05.880 he knocked all the bones out of my body
00:14:08.820 don't don't worry I imagine take care of
00:14:11.160 his bones as well it affects his ability
00:14:13.920 to fire straight this is the best [ __ ]
00:14:15.839 I've ever done for a video
00:14:18.779 uh I don't know if you can dodge this
00:14:21.839 way
00:14:24.720 oh my [ __ ] God that was so cool
00:14:26.760 legalized nuclear bombs following a nine
00:14:29.880 second engagement in my skin relocation
00:14:32.160 the boss decides that actually no just
00:14:35.459 just no
00:14:36.680 what I call this move the uh the
00:14:39.660 reaction base thank you the
00:14:41.220 starscouragement it's really enjoyable
00:14:43.019 when the boss [ __ ] fights me from a
00:14:44.760 different dimension I I don't think
00:14:46.680 procedure sax is supposed to be doing
00:14:48.300 this he's he's loading right now he can
00:14:50.880 even use a laser to teleport me uh
00:14:53.279 straight into the grave his aim is
00:14:55.139 really uh
00:14:56.720 uh his name is really [ __ ] up without
00:14:59.100 his butt Witness

00:15:55.740 people to death and he's got about up 15
00:15:57.899 ways to do it number 13 the Palestinian
00:16:01.199 high five this boss I do not consider
00:16:03.600 very fast I consider him [ __ ] and a
00:16:06.240 big part of that [ __ ] is the sheer
00:16:07.620 [ __ ] speed at which this man gives
00:16:09.240 London handshakes bro they made
00:16:10.680 bloodborne like four consoles ago you
00:16:12.720 gotta move on buddy gaming in 2015 was
00:16:14.820 [ __ ] up we've got a lot of fun attacks
00:16:16.980 with this guy like rocks and uh hey
00:16:20.820 there Broski how's the weather today why
00:16:22.980 are the respawns here like that so after
00:16:24.720 a long game of Fetch with a normal sized
00:16:26.699 Pitbull who clearly has not had enough
00:16:28.440 preschoolers here you go buddy I'll I'll
00:16:30.180 fix that one right up for you all right
00:16:31.740 class today we're going to choose the
00:16:33.420 strongest I decided to take this dog on
00:16:35.399 a long walk
00:16:36.660 behind the shed he's going to a farm up
00:16:38.820 stage
00:16:45.860 oh [ __ ] there's a spider on my hand
00:16:59.959 if destined to death is
00:17:03.240 truly thy longing
00:17:08.160 then claim it
00:17:19.880 I'm going to [ __ ] skin you alive
00:17:35.640 okay so welcome to the evil shelter I
00:17:37.620 called that because the dog euthanizes
00:17:39.059 you malakope and seeds and the whack ape
00:17:41.340 of meth is quite the quite definitely
00:17:43.559 the fight he is so fast so aggressive
00:17:46.140 and so Airborne that it makes me wonder
00:17:49.080 uh when do I get to play the game that I
00:17:51.419 bought you are literally fighting death
00:17:53.100 right now so if it kills you you have to
00:17:55.260 start a new character look I don't make
00:17:57.179 the rules around here okay I feel like
00:17:58.679 most of this is just trying to hit him
00:18:00.660 ever and the rage on that sword means
00:18:03.000 the Heap isn't going to share that issue
00:18:04.860 for lack of a better word malekith is an
00:18:07.320 absolute Beast because not only do his
00:18:09.179 attacks drain your health slowly and
00:18:11.039 quickly but they also reduce your
00:18:12.840 natural lifespan usually to a few
00:18:14.880 seconds he also lowers your height to
00:18:16.799 negative six alright guys so I figured
00:18:19.380 out the bone remover Works in cut scenes
00:18:21.059 I can't really tell if this makes the
00:18:22.260 fight easier or harder he's having some
00:18:24.600 mobility issue where am I going this is
00:18:27.600 not a battle of attrition we are not
00:18:29.280 going to be low in healing but we are
00:18:31.140 going to be low in Hell malacath might
00:18:32.700 be damaging mobile and especially
00:18:34.440 aggressive please please let me play the
00:18:36.900 game now but what he isn't is able to
00:18:39.179 survive the base candidate we can't
00:18:40.620 outspace now again and we certainly
00:18:42.240 aren't going to out maneuver him but
00:18:43.980 what we can do is out Dance malagathe
00:18:46.080 I'm very good at it and with the right
00:18:47.820 combination of dodging and punishing and
00:18:49.740 staying uncomfortably close to the boss
00:18:51.539 you smell pretty good battle cat we just
00:18:53.820 might be able to take this dog down
00:18:56.940 at least that's the theory in practice
00:18:59.160 it's easier said than done
00:19:04.780 [Music]
00:19:49.100 oh I'm a I'm a big fan of ominous
00:19:51.840 crucifixis
00:20:10.820 the Rune of death is Unbound
00:20:16.220 and that is probably a bad thing
00:20:21.440 now death is once more
00:20:25.160 a part of this world
00:20:29.940 things definitely weren't dying before I
00:20:32.940 checked
00:20:36.780 your destiny lies close at hand
00:20:39.059 tarnished make the lands between whole
00:20:42.840 again

00:20:56.039 really important errands to do right now

00:24:29.120 there's no need to worry tarnished
00:24:34.140 foreign
00:24:53.720 evil boss I can tell he's evil because
00:24:56.460 of all the incestors in the pedophilia
00:25:00.840 don't don't pay attention to the ominous
00:25:02.580 rings in the scary music it just means
00:25:05.700 he likes you as the Lord of blood Mo
00:25:07.440 utilizes a variety of sanguine schemes
00:25:09.480 such as the flashback the blood force
00:25:11.940 trauma and the
00:25:13.559 shower it's the Ultimate Weapon against
00:25:15.480 a gamer but most importantly moog's main
00:25:17.820 attack is removing the blood from your
00:25:19.380 body and then throwing it back at you
00:25:21.000 nice try buddy that shit's full of
00:25:22.440 microplastics by the way this boss is
00:25:24.240 waitably damaged because why not
00:25:30.080 overall Moog is a simple fight in theory
00:25:33.240 which is great because I have a simple
00:25:34.919 mind every single attack is fair and
00:25:37.080 telegraphed even if it's a little too
00:25:39.179 tell around and he certainly doesn't
00:25:40.980 need to jump across the arena seven
00:25:42.659 times in a row you can really tell I'm
00:25:44.279 not bad about it despite being punishing
00:25:46.020 Vogue is one of the best bosses in the
00:25:47.700 entire game although I think he could
00:25:49.080 use a little bit more blood really
00:25:50.820 really haven't seen enough of that just
00:25:52.440 uh being careful what you wish for

00:00:00.080 on the last episode of Elden ring which
00:00:03.600 was 9 months ago you could have had a
00:00:06.080 child during that time our hero set out
00:00:08.280 once again with the noble and realistic
00:00:10.280 goal of killing God a task that led them
00:00:13.599 to the highest of Peaks the greatest of

00:06:18.440 wet floor sign I'm going to need that to
00:06:20.160 clean up the
00:06:25.360 blood how did you get a horse up here I
00:06:28.000 am genuinely curious sorry about what
00:06:30.000 happened to your family by the way and
00:06:32.039 uh your soul apparently look I know that
00:06:35.000 sounds bad but in my defense I was
00:06:37.759 really hungry uh go go gadget bubble
00:06:40.280 attack you and that bubble have been
00:06:42.039 nothing but trouble it's time to end
00:06:45.960 it I I don't think her AI can handle
00:06:48.400 that this boss is quite the challenge
00:06:50.880 plus a little bit more with the only
00:06:53.080 consolation being that I bought it five
00:06:55.199 times already and it didn't even help
00:06:58.000 mainly because Loretta has an ungodly
00:07:00.199 amount of magic and if you don't close
00:07:01.840 the distance she will literally never
00:07:03.639 stop shooting at you like bro please I
00:07:07.560 just want to heal right now it looks so
00:07:10.080 [ __ ] cool though I have never had so
00:07:12.120 much fun getting destroyed let's just uh
00:07:14.520 send this [ __ ] to the glue factory
00:07:15.840 please going to [ __ ] take her out
00:07:17.520 behind the
00:07:28.120 Stables so after after defeating the
00:07:30.039 funny horse we descend the length of the
00:07:32.160 haling tree and pass
00:07:34.919 the what a thrill normally siiz ladder
00:07:38.520 why why would you build it like this
00:07:40.520 down to the city of our heart's desire
00:07:43.319 El fail brace of the hailing
00:07:46.879 tree kind of a shitty tree if you have
00:07:49.080 to brace it oh God I'm sorry for
00:07:50.639 slandering your city I'm sure it's
00:07:52.479 really nice this time of year and I can
00:07:54.599 definitely say that it is absolutely
00:07:57.840 breathtaking in a literal sense I have a
00:08:00.680 died here a lot okay nice place you got
00:08:03.039 here can't wait to give it a new paint
00:08:04.960 job this is the final Legacy dungeon of
00:08:07.639 the game and as a result of that the uh
00:08:10.440 most insane gripping the haly tree with
00:08:12.800 a golden veneer lale betrays its true
00:08:15.360 nature of dark and Sinister
00:08:17.639 Decay especially when it comes to the
00:08:19.960 back alleys on the wrong side of town I
00:08:22.919 [ __ ] genuinely how is this legal oh
00:08:25.520 sweet cool it's another one yeah no I'm

00:08:30.919 minutes of the Stree by the
00:08:38.120 way wow I can't wait to meet the guy who
00:08:40.519 owns this place really hope that he's
00:08:42.080 not up to anything up Sinister or
00:08:44.720 insestuous because that would be [ __ ]
00:08:47.720 weird something is telling me I'm not
00:08:49.839 supposed to go this way the death
00:08:51.399 cannons are giving me up bad vibes how

00:09:42.320 special you got this man uh where she
00:09:45.519 can do is kill
00:09:46.530 [Music]
00:09:55.560 you hey there babe uh
00:10:01.079 were you born on a
00:10:02.980 [Music]
00:10:12.279 Minefield I jumped for so long that I
00:10:15.640 thought I had
00:10:17.440 died
00:10:19.320 hoping
00:10:21.480 pleading awaiting the return of my
00:10:24.079 brother
00:10:26.399 mola so about that
00:10:30.760 I have killed 15 of you today I will
00:10:33.360 kill 20 of you
00:10:35.519 tomorrow and one day my brother will
00:10:38.519 find his way home by the smell of the
00:10:43.120 bodies heed my
00:10:46.519 warning I am melenia blade of Mika
00:10:55.210 [Music]
00:10:59.360 and I have never known
00:11:02.959 defeat well you're about to
00:11:05.900 [Music]
00:11:11.519 [ __ ] hey guys welcome back to the fight
00:11:13.839 with a melatonin blade of Michelin I can
00:11:17.240 remember that name because she says it
00:11:19.160 every time she kills you which is a lot
00:11:22.480 I am melenia blade of Mika I am melenia
00:11:25.880 I am
00:11:28.040 melenia can you you [ __ ] stop now
00:11:30.680 Melania blade of mola is the hardest
00:11:32.959 boss that fromsoft has ever made and
00:11:34.920 there are several good reasons for this
00:11:37.040 the first of which being no she isn't I
00:11:39.839 just happen to have a sense of Shame she
00:11:41.800 is incredibly fast incredibly tanky
00:11:44.480 chains incredibly long Combos and gains
00:11:47.040 Health after every hit making this less
00:11:49.639 of an endurance fight and more of a
00:11:51.320 goddamn Marathon punishing you with a
00:11:53.279 grave setback for each and every mistake
00:11:56.240 which for me is a frequent occurrence
00:11:59.040 not not to mention that the boss is so
00:12:01.000 confident she will wait for you to
00:12:04.120 attack quite a while actually I honestly
00:12:07.079 think I [ __ ] confused her she was not
00:12:09.399 ready for the spread eagle strategy
00:12:11.440 Madia demands nothing short of absolute
00:12:14.040 perfection where every move must be
00:12:15.880 calculated and anticipated right up
00:12:18.320 until she jumps in the air at which
00:12:19.920 point you are done playing the game just
00:12:22.079 put the controller down now buddy if you
00:12:24.000 are ever caught by this move at any time
00:12:26.839 you are dead there is no dodging it
00:12:29.399 there is no tanking it there is only
00:12:31.240 running away from it and watching it get
00:12:33.160 closer no matter what you do some part
00:12:35.720 of this thing is going to hit and when
00:12:37.320 it does it is going to extend this boss
00:12:39.199 fight by a lot personally I uh don't
00:12:42.639 really know why people have problems
00:12:43.760 with this boss I'm going to get a
00:12:45.279 [ __ ] glass of water real quick really
00:12:47.800 Madia is the type of fight that you are
00:12:50.000 never actually ready for and I can say
00:12:51.880 with absolute certainty that nothing in
00:12:54.279 the game could have equipped me for this
00:12:55.839 not even you a boneless 10 times speed
00:12:57.920 Mor go she is the fastest strikes the
00:13:01.000 hardest and changes between all of her
00:13:03.199 attacks seemingly at random making for a
00:13:06.079 boss that you can never quite predict
00:13:08.160 much less understand but ultimately
00:13:10.399 those are just the reasons that I keep
00:13:11.959 coming back to her again and again and
00:13:15.360 again I I do plan on finishing it taking
00:13:17.920 pure unadulterated pleasure in finally
00:13:20.240 conquering a boss that really really
00:13:22.240 wants you
00:13:23.880 dead and the feelings
00:13:26.680 Mutual I am Millenia
00:13:29.760 a blade of
00:13:36.000 mea uh sorry didn't quite catch the
00:13:48.199 name pretty cool looking tree

00:14:30.880 horror at the hands of the Scarlet

00:00:03.840 elen ring shadow of the ER tree is the
00:00:07.200 newest and greatest installment in a
00:00:09.320 series that I can only describe as the
00:00:11.480 refined man's flatulation recognized and
00:00:14.320 Infamous for having such straight
00:00:16.000 forward story and gameplay that there
00:00:17.560 are literally hundreds of YouTubers
00:00:19.720 whose job it is to explain the things
00:00:21.640 that happen at it now suffice it to say
00:00:24.760 I'm going to be doing a lot of that
00:00:25.920 today but I can assure you the accuracy
00:00:28.720 of my statements are gen described as
00:00:31.160 Highly Questionable at best as I am
00:00:33.320 currently being hunted in 39 kingdoms
00:00:35.079 for crimes against information taking
00:00:37.520 place inside the brand new realm of
00:00:39.600 shadow where the developers accidentally
00:00:41.800 created an entire new game of content
00:00:44.000 and pretended it was DLC this novel
00:00:46.840 expansion promises to deliver a whole
00:00:48.680 new world of masochism and internal
00:00:50.960 injury all the while providing a
00:00:53.000 generous serving of beautiful and
00:00:54.800 breathtaking Vistas at approximately the
00:00:57.359 same rate as it scares the blood outside
00:00:59.480 of your body
00:01:00.640 and you would be very surprised just how
00:01:03.120 much one man can lead to explore this
00:01:05.760 contrasting land of putrid possibilities
00:01:08.119 we play as the tarnished one of many
00:01:11.040 horrifying insults to God who primarily
00:01:13.240 fight their enemies by drinking a soda
00:01:15.119 that sends your bones into Attack Mode
00:01:17.400 finally sent to the land of Shadow upon
00:01:19.280 hearing the news that Moog Lord of blood
00:01:21.759 has beaten the allegations and wishes to
00:01:24.360 Sue this blonde twink for defamation of
00:01:26.840 character all throughout the lands
00:01:29.200 between our enemies crave the sweet
00:01:31.640 merciful Embrace of death and for the
00:01:34.200 delicious Taste of finely crafted steel
00:01:37.200 this is the story of one such tarish who
00:01:39.520 chose to heed their harrowing call to
00:01:42.040 challenge the authority of the very Gods
00:01:44.759 themselves and to pursue the all
00:01:47.040 powerful Elden ring
00:02:23.959 Micha the kind spoke of many things that
00:02:27.400 the birth of a god oft requires
00:02:29.440 sacrifice
00:02:31.280 and for each light that
00:02:33.000 Dawn a shadow is cast in
00:02:37.360 kind thus did he depart to the place
00:02:39.920 cloaked Eternal in Twilight In Search of
00:02:42.680 his Birthright his
00:02:47.640 godhood and now from you I request
00:02:50.480 something similar to find the PATH
00:02:53.239 Sanctified by micholas stride to venture
00:02:56.560 with us to the lands of
00:03:01.239 Shadow what the [ __ ] are you talking
00:03:03.159 about a land whose wonders shall never
00:03:05.720 be put to
00:03:06.959 song doomed to be forgotten
00:03:09.780 [Music]
00:03:11.360 Evermore where the remnants of an
00:03:13.599 ancient war suffer even still the
00:03:16.799 indignities of
00:03:18.400 defeat and the abandonment of
00:03:22.080 Victory the land under the wings of the
00:03:25.000 dread Lord veale in the Gaze of the
00:03:28.760 beasts once
00:03:32.280 Divine and cloaked eternally in the
00:03:34.920 ashes of mesmer's
00:03:38.319 flame all to follow in the footsteps of
00:03:41.280 kindly niola across all Corners it may
00:03:45.080 lead to complete his
00:03:47.560 journey to witness his
00:03:52.799 Ascension go now touch the withered arm
00:03:56.720 and journey to the land
00:03:58.560 forgotten I I will not be far behind may
00:04:02.079 we meet again
00:04:06.120 [Music]
00:04:36.000 [Music]
00:04:41.440 so after being banished to the literal
00:04:42.960 Shadow realm we take our first steps
00:04:44.759 into the spirit grave Plains the
00:04:46.840 beautiful and Majestic sight of a
00:04:48.639 cataclysmic ancient war or more
00:04:51.080 accurately a cataclysmic ancient
00:04:53.360 genocide you see I can use my inductive
00:04:55.600 reasoning skills to deduce that uh
00:04:57.560 people died here and we are going to be
00:04:59.720 adding to that total now so this is the
00:05:01.759 uh first enemy in the DLC and a great
00:05:04.360 choice for beginners I really like the
00:05:06.199 part where he just never stops pursuing
00:05:08.160 You Who ah greetings tarnished one your
00:05:11.400 presence here is fortuitous for I bear a
00:05:14.280 burdensome quest of grave import should
00:05:17.039 you be willing [ __ ] wait a second okay
00:05:19.639 so I have greatly misinterpreted his
00:05:22.160 Acro this guy is really interested in

00:05:29.319 not looking
00:05:35.520 good now seeing as my physical safety is
00:05:38.560 currently an open question we have to
00:05:40.639 equip ourselves with brand new threads
00:05:42.680 every single time I walk into a new
00:05:44.199 place yes I am going to keep the jar on
00:05:46.160 during sex it comforts me and by hunting
00:05:49.319 a homeless man to death in the woods
00:05:51.039 where no one will hear me scream this
00:05:53.080 enables us to explore and investigate
00:05:55.039 all kinds of new and amazing structures
00:05:57.080 that distinctly alter how and where the
00:05:59.080 game is going to kill you as well as
00:06:00.800 shaping our interactions with the
00:06:02.520 various local Wildlife I'm kyote

00:06:19.759 and of course the uh dread Army of
00:06:21.759 Eternal Pursuit thus the Covenant of
00:06:23.759 Fate is bound in your doom inable this

00:06:33.240 computer thanks me for rendering this
00:06:34.800 every day wandering erratically in a
00:06:36.960 given direction we promly take shelter
00:06:39.039 in a random cave only to realize that
00:06:41.400 that was a horrible mistake and that
00:06:43.720 this is no random cave oh God oh God
00:06:48.520 what the [ __ ] is that
00:06:51.280 thing okay so I ain't going to sugar

00:07:00.080 unlearn this information and honestly I

00:07:04.400 brother in Christ you firebomb ral's

00:07:25.520 the confines of the Cobalt mines with
00:07:27.319 the status of the extremely cracked out
00:07:29.120 monkey bom

00:11:30.560 my
00:11:33.079 grandon so she does
00:11:44.440 remember welcome everyone to the first
00:11:46.920 major boss of the DLC Divine Beast
00:11:49.959 dancing lion who is not an actual lion
00:11:53.120 but are in fact two very coordinated
00:11:55.120 people inside of a big suit presumably
00:11:57.720 so they can sneak into a movie theater
00:11:59.800 somebody is like grabbing him with the
00:12:01.639 Gmod physics gun and attached a couple
00:12:03.519 thrusters to
00:12:04.680 him dancing lion is the perfect
00:12:07.000 introduction to this game's DLC bosses
00:12:09.440 both functioning as a difficult
00:12:10.880 challenge for the player and also as a
00:12:13.000 massive warning sign because this [ __ ]
00:12:14.959 is not going to get any easier for you I
00:12:17.320 am uh having difficulties killing Mr
00:12:19.160 Beast perhaps he should make real videos
00:12:21.440 like mine starting out the fight in
00:12:23.320 Phase One the Divine Beast is actually a
00:12:25.519 very manageable foe offering us a pretty
00:12:28.120 decent hurdle in terms of timing and
00:12:30.040 aggression but a less decent hurdle when
00:12:32.320 it comes to his incredibly funny
00:12:34.120 cameraman SC this however is merely a
00:12:36.639 glimpse into what fearsome and
00:12:38.079 frightening assaults lie just around the
00:12:40.199 corner and after a brief yet
00:12:42.040 exhilarating bout Divine Beast finally
00:12:44.440 enters Phase 2 by channeling the power
00:12:46.279 of the
00:12:48.519 ear entire atmosphere gaining access to
00:12:51.680 three related yet distinct Elemental
00:12:53.839 phases each one an absolute wrecking
00:12:56.000 ball to both my health bar bar and this
00:12:57.959 video's bit rate with the lightning
00:12:59.880 phase adding a great deal of range and
00:13:01.839 aftershocks the frost phase adding big
00:13:03.920 stumps and punishing damage and the
00:13:05.959 storm phase adding in 50 tornado sirens
00:13:08.959 Jesus Christ I'm fighting the [ __ ]
00:13:10.519 Avatar going from an ostensively
00:13:12.399 straightforward battle to a ruthlessly
00:13:14.360 engaging and unpredictable Gauntlet
00:13:16.839 switching between all manner of elements
00:13:18.680 to keep you on your toes while giving
00:13:20.399 you precious few moments to breathe or
00:13:22.399 reciprocate Because by the time you've
00:13:24.440 gotten used to an element he is already
00:13:26.440 switching to the next one greatly
00:13:28.279 compounding even further into the fight
00:13:30.040 when the Divine Beast shifts into a
00:13:31.720 medley of every element back to back
00:13:34.000 forcing you to flee in abject Terror
00:13:36.279 while the boss channels the power of the
00:13:38.079 four elements and number two will shock
00:13:40.839 you so despite and because of this chaos
00:13:43.959 Divine Beast dancing Lon is an
00:13:45.839 absolutely Peak fight balancing out
00:13:48.279 explosive violence with a myriad of
00:13:50.399 openings each one gated by the guesses
00:13:52.399 and Gables that you are willing to take
00:13:54.839 and I just so happen to be very bad at
00:13:57.279 the casino
00:14:25.639 we
00:14:37.860 [Music]
00:14:45.240 so after defeating our enthusiastic
00:14:47.360 celebration of Chinese New Year we
00:14:49.160 Ascend to the very peak of bat's Twisted
00:14:51.519 Tower bathed in the stutting presence of
00:14:53.680 the Shadow tree climbing with baited
00:14:56.079 breath its sweeping stairs before
00:14:57.920 finally reaching
00:15:00.600 the mailbox how did you get a letter up
00:15:03.040 here tarnished I hope this letter
00:15:05.000 reaches the unscathed for it would be
00:15:07.160 treacherous if that weird lion
00:15:08.480 downstairs woke up beyond the tower
00:15:10.800 sealed by Shadow lies a place known as
00:15:13.320 the gates of divinity surely this is the
00:15:18.160 ultimate goal of kindly Mika and thus if
00:15:21.759 we are united in common cause it is
00:15:24.320 there that we must head I don't know you
00:15:27.759 follow the crosses of Mika East to the
00:15:30.639 Grim castle of Enis and Beyond there to
00:15:34.279 the shadow keep surely it is there that
00:15:37.720 our answers lie I await an audience with
00:15:40.680 thee should fate follow thy
00:15:45.160 arrival love you pooky bear so after
00:15:48.319 entering the Mushroom Kingdom and
00:15:50.000 receiving a letter from Bowser we decide
00:15:52.000 to take a break from our DLC duties by
00:15:54.240 pushing the Character Creator to its
00:15:55.560 absolute limits beyond the boundaries of
00:15:57.399 God and man he's so beautiful like a
00:16:00.639 sunrise over the crashing waves because
00:16:03.360 as it turns out my sponsor gamer Subs
00:16:05.800 wandering Merchant of the energy drinks
00:16:08.600 literally allows me to slander them by
00:16:10.319 creating funny builds in characters
00:16:12.040 based on each of their terrifying
00:16:13.639 flavors and ever since then have been
00:16:16.120 begging me to stop so if you want to
00:16:18.079 know more about how to get energy
00:16:19.199 delivered at a low price this might not
00:16:21.440 be the right video okay so the first
00:16:23.440 thing on our list is going to be uh lean
00:16:26.160 which definitely does not depict
00:16:27.560 President Joe Biden on it because if
00:16:29.360 they did they would receive an actual
00:16:31.079 cease and assist letter from the
00:16:32.240 Department of Homeland Security it would
00:16:34.600 be really bad if that hypothetically
00:16:36.360 happened raw meat going to be a bit of a
00:16:39.519 big boy today has a lot of meat inside
00:16:42.000 of him I'm taking that to the extreme by
00:16:43.839 the way uh this man has no room for
00:16:45.759 bones AFK sleep support going to be
00:16:48.720 using an Arcane sleep build he doesn't
00:16:51.440 actually do any damage because of his
00:16:53.000 lack of negative side effects not really
00:16:55.440 sure what you're supposed to do with
00:16:56.440 this one honestly the official Max or up
00:16:59.440 who is unfortunately invisible because
00:17:01.319 you do not know what it looks like yet
00:17:03.120 stay tuned for updates on this guy and
00:17:05.359 last but not least we have code maxor
00:17:07.799 with zero for 10% off Gamers Subs
00:17:09.880 purchases who has a lot of stamina
00:17:12.359 because he is just so healthy you can
00:17:15.160 find him inside the description of the
00:17:16.760 video just please do not tell gamer Subs
00:17:19.400 that I'm making this it's going to be
00:17:20.880 our little secret from now
00:17:25.400 on moving on across the Great Bridge to
00:17:28.119 the Grand castle of Enis we immediately
00:17:30.960 get distracted with random caves because
00:17:32.720 this game has content again can I just
00:17:34.919 blow up the [ __ ] ey you know the item
00:17:37.559 is going to be good when it's placed
00:17:38.600 next to 20 explosives so we make our way
00:17:41.360 over to the uh scariest location in the
00:17:43.360 entire game featuring a wide variety of
00:17:45.600 hilarious jump scares and funny skeleton
00:17:47.679 boss fights what the [ __ ] kind of crack
00:17:49.679 they got in the Paris catacombs you know
00:17:51.840 the item is going to be good when it's
00:17:53.000 placed next to the giant blood stain
00:17:55.280 okay look I get this game is supposed to
00:17:56.600 be hard but I can't Ife frame the
00:17:58.520 ceiling
00:17:59.480 so after spending 35 hours in the ball
00:18:01.679 crushing facility we decide to head
00:18:03.679 south to one of Elden Ring's
00:18:04.960 characteristic extremely high therad
00:18:07.080 dungeons where the boiling magma can
00:18:08.840 best be described as a minor
00:18:10.799 inconvenience me enjoying the coolest
00:18:12.960 summer for the rest of my life yeah lava
00:18:14.880 and Elden ring is just like not a big
00:18:16.440 deal apparently the water's fine guys I
00:18:18.080 don't know what you're complaining
00:18:20.159 about what vile bail is this homeless
00:18:24.039 man okay my contempt for you is nigh but

00:18:46.039 nearest homeless man we blindly and
00:18:47.880 uncritically follow his directions
00:18:49.440 straight into 4 hours of hidden content
00:18:51.640 this is going to be a theme in the
00:18:53.120 future including his directions that
00:18:55.000 tell us to jump directly into a
00:18:56.679 bottomless pit
00:19:00.240 that is false advertising Egon gave me
00:19:02.280 some crazy [ __ ]
00:19:06.159 Edibles it was around this time that the
00:19:08.600 game began subtly suggesting to me that
00:19:11.280 I may wish to come back at a later time
00:19:13.679 and I chose to ignore it oh oh this
00:19:17.159 isn't a good place to be welcome back
00:19:19.240 kid we missed you it's almost as if the
00:19:22.039 game was specifically trying to prevent

00:20:20.039 guys you can't make fun of it we are
00:20:21.880 greeted by the beautiful and enthralling
00:20:23.640 landscape of the southern coast realm of
00:20:26.559 contrasting colors and Majestic saffron
00:20:30.480 Shores except the landscape here isn't
00:20:32.720 actually yellow I'm just [ __ ] with

00:20:53.280 wrong neighborhood [ __ ] we need
00:20:54.480 to Le
00:20:59.070 [Music]
00:21:04.640 welcome to the southern coast a lande
00:21:07.000 comprised of many distinct areas each
00:21:09.000 with their own unique and stunning color
00:21:10.840 schemes including but not limited to the
00:21:13.559 Crimson Countryside the zurab Bode the
00:21:16.880 funny finger family and of course the
00:21:19.520 secret green area that no one will tell
00:21:21.480 you about this one is a maxor video
00:21:23.880 exclusive moving on through the red part
00:21:26.039 of the map while ignoring the various
00:21:27.880 color combinations
00:21:29.039 we decide to take shelter in the local
00:21:30.760 torture dungeon where we could find the
00:21:32.679 Undisputed best item in the entire game
00:21:38.039 three the ability to scream we did this
00:21:40.960 for like 10 minutes just do what I do
00:21:43.520 when I have
00:21:45.559 problems oh okay so this is the uh this
00:21:49.000 is the
00:21:50.039 boss oh no I am really intimidated right
00:21:53.760 now this man's got confidence
00:22:01.120 now out of every horrifying area that
00:22:03.000 we've seen in this game the southern
00:22:04.760 coast definitely Takes the Cake in terms
00:22:06.679 of visual Splendor consistently
00:22:08.840 capturing the player's imagination and
00:22:10.640 attention to the detriment of everything
00:22:12.840 else there are so many beautiful things
00:22:15.400 to see around here and the only thing
00:22:17.120 that could make it better was if all of
00:22:18.640 them didn't want to kill me usually with
00:22:20.480 a very intense
00:22:22.880 immediacy it's a
00:22:25.679 monkey you [ __ ] you okay man you look
00:22:28.640 kind of I appear to have made a
00:22:34.320 friend so after engaging in a great deal
00:22:37.039 of Monkey Business we ride to the east
00:22:38.960 of the Cerulean Coast past the glowing
00:22:41.240 cross where Mika abandoned his horse
00:22:42.880 skin or something I don't know I'm not a
00:22:44.480 lore expert and pacing along the beach
00:22:46.440 with a suspicious amount of fingers
00:22:48.520 before finally reaching Our Mysterious
00:22:53.799 destination and immediately wanting to
00:22:55.960 go back I am okay with allowing it to
00:22:58.000 remain the series
00:22:59.400 holy Jesus Christ what is all this it's
00:23:03.240 the finger family we we we found the
00:23:05.480 finger family
00:23:07.000 dude what these are the finger ruins
00:23:10.559 where Miyazaki uncontent with his weird
00:23:12.440 foot fetish has decided to move on to
00:23:14.159 the next best thing and even more
00:23:16.320 disturbing than that these ruins are
00:23:18.320 exclusively occupied by the funny suck
00:23:20.799 men who I spent 40 minutes getting
00:23:22.919 sucked by because this area is just so
00:23:25.440 difficult oh my God what the [ __ ] are
00:23:29.039 you that is that is not normal I'm just
00:23:32.159 going to forget this place ever existed
00:23:34.240 committing to the bit has led me to
00:23:35.480 places that I would not go with a
00:23:40.120 gun heading on over to the southernmost
00:23:42.679 edge of the seruan Coast or
00:23:44.320 hypothetically some other color we
00:23:46.720 encounter this mysterious giant hole
00:23:49.120 which upon further investigation goes
00:23:51.480 into the ground
00:23:54.400 Bo why is his scream so lifelike and
00:23:57.480 after a consider considerable fault of
00:23:59.080 navigation we descend further into the
00:24:01.159 Arcane Abyss before finally revealing
00:24:03.279 the secrets
00:24:06.400 within fissure deps domain of remarkable
00:24:10.039 Revelations and sleepy subd auge full of
00:24:13.039 enemies that want nothing more than to
00:24:14.559 give us a nice nap for the rest of our
00:24:17.039 lives as well as the immortal Footprints
00:24:19.360 of the imperian Nicola forever inscribed
00:24:21.640 on this enduring cross I abandon here my
00:24:25.200 love Yeah Micha I've been there too I
00:24:28.960 wish I could throw Stephanie into a
00:24:30.360 giant pit okay actually though that is
00:24:32.640 uh genuinely concerning like U Can I
00:24:36.399 have it this is the EP Zone you can tell
00:24:39.200 because of how relaxing it is especially
00:24:41.279 when it comes to the giant slug ASMR
00:24:44.159 this is just genuinely unpleasant to
00:24:46.159 hear but you know what isn't relaxing
00:24:48.840 literally everything else I am here
00:24:50.840 significantly before I'm supposed to be
00:24:53.039 heading further into the mangled
00:24:54.399 Mausoleum we uncover a new weapon with a
00:24:57.640 new status of called Eternal sleep which
00:25:01.200 in my personal experience can be applied
00:25:03.960 to most weapons so after experimenting
00:25:06.440 with a lot of opiates at the hands of
00:25:07.919 the local drug dealers we encounter a
00:25:10.240 sedated sorority of animals engaged
00:25:12.720 together in a sleepover so good that
00:25:14.919 they will never wake up again and I'm
00:25:17.039 going to say what nobody else is willing
00:25:18.440 to say America has a fenal crisis is is
00:25:21.880 your first [ __ ] Instinct just to kill
00:25:23.520 all the Sleeping animals dude like if I
00:25:25.919 can Target it it needs to die ho [ __ ]
00:25:28.840 blindly accepting the advice of the last
00:25:30.600 guy who died trying we jump directly
00:25:32.480 into the gaping Abyss with absolutely no
00:25:34.799 regard for the consequences
00:25:39.840 boom is he okay eventually leading us to
00:25:42.960 the foundation of the Fisher deps and in
00:25:45.159 turn the putrescent
00:25:50.240 night welcome back tree Sentinal we
00:25:53.039 missed you this boss is pretty hilarious
00:25:56.360 not because he holds his attacks until
00:25:57.679 the heat death Universe although he does
00:26:00.360 do that but rather being a literal
00:26:02.520 skeleton riding his own skin putes has a
00:26:05.279 habit of moving away from you during his
00:26:07.360 only attack windows and also he's
00:26:09.559 [ __ ] horrified no matter what I do I
00:26:12.039 just cannot seem to hit him in the same
00:26:14.320 way that I just cannot seem to interpret
00:26:16.480 what I am currently looking at this is
00:26:18.559 what happens to your horse when he
00:26:19.600 survives the glue factory like bro I
00:26:22.640 that is not okay mom said it's my turn
00:26:24.919 to do the attack compos overall
00:26:27.279 putrescent Knight truly represents the
00:26:29.360 southern coast both in terms of its
00:26:31.200 intrinsic Beauty and its congenital
00:26:33.360 Terror especially considering the fact
00:26:35.360 that you aren't supposed to go here yet
00:26:37.360 and the game spent at least 2 hours
00:26:39.120 trying to tell me that this is all to
00:26:40.960 say that I have dug my grave far too
00:26:43.159 deep to climb out now and the irony of
00:26:44.919 this setting is not L of me
00:27:02.670 [Music]
00:27:08.279 tarnished do you grow weary of this life
00:27:13.600 Longing To shelter from suffering with
00:27:17.360 eternal sleep you know honestly I wasn't
00:27:20.120 before but uh then I looked at you in by
00:27:23.240 darnest in my choicy nectar in the
00:27:27.279 Velvet brace of St Trina you lie at
00:27:32.600 peace
00:27:42.200 forever that just kills you I guess it
00:27:45.240 was just all a dream what a what a
00:27:47.960 lovely NPC honestly so after
00:27:50.279 unfortunately suffering an overdose at
00:27:51.880 the hands of the local drug dealers we
00:27:54.240 decide to head instead to the craggy
00:27:55.919 landscape of the jagged Peak which is in
00:27:58.720 fact where I was supposed to go in the
00:28:00.360 first place a Sinister and looming
00:28:02.480 feature of the landscape visible from
00:28:04.000 almost every location rumor dwelling of
00:28:06.440 forces most malicious and home to the
00:28:08.919 funniest Wildlife thus seen in the lands
00:28:10.720 between with our first example being the
00:28:13.080 jagged Peak Drake which despite being a
00:28:15.519 fairly rudimentary fight that we' have
00:28:16.919 done 15 times already implies the
00:28:19.880 existence of a jagged Peak Josh I'm just
00:28:22.200 going to not play this one honestly
00:28:24.039 riding further east along this
00:28:25.279 Mountain's broken Bluffs and sharp
00:28:26.880 Stones we navigate this dismal and
00:28:29.120 desolate terrain wondering what stunning
00:28:31.200 content lies just ahead only to find two
00:28:34.399 more of the exact same Dragon prompting
00:28:36.640 me to immediately terminate my
00:28:38.159 playthrough oh it's Jagged Peak Drake
00:28:40.600 again and he's fighting Jagged Peak Josh
00:28:43.240 at least I am don't have to play the
00:28:45.519 game now it's almost as if the game was
00:28:47.880 specifically trying to prevent me from
00:28:49.320 getting
00:28:52.760 here God damn it not this guy again
00:28:56.480 no in my unyielding state of Rage you've
00:29:01.720 made me forget the name of the we in
00:29:05.279 that book it's called Moby Dick Dam you
00:29:10.360 Bale Drake
00:29:12.600 Warrior Mighty Drake Warrior I prefer
00:29:16.640 Kendrick personally upon the top of this
00:29:19.159 rotten Peak lies a dragon most foul a
00:29:24.080 dragon who has thus confounded me it is
00:29:28.840 Moby Dick Bale rotten vile damnable Bale
00:29:36.360 King of the jagged
00:29:40.360 Mountain slay bail slay him with me and
00:29:47.360 feast on his heart you know what I'm I'm
00:29:51.080 just not going to tell you
00:29:53.840 now so after listening to the ramblings
00:29:56.320 of a homeless man for the SE time today
00:29:59.240 we Ascend sharply up the mountain filled
00:30:01.440 with a new sense of motivation and
00:30:03.279 purpose further and greatly emphasized
00:30:05.720 by the hilarious string of Ludy Tunes
00:30:07.960 obstacles oh my God it's the best fight
00:30:11.120 in the entire game the 15th Dragon I'm
00:30:15.240 so grateful they put this here instead
00:30:16.799 of anything else fleeing further upward
00:30:19.360 surpassing the realm of geographical
00:30:21.120 possibility we are carried beyond the
00:30:23.159 height of anything seen until now to a
00:30:25.640 path covered in not but rugged rocks and
00:30:28.200 ridiculously violent weather why is the
00:30:30.360 sky on fire it's a gender reveal party
00:30:33.279 before finally rising to the mighty
00:30:35.360 Summit of the jagged Peak where we will
00:30:37.360 await the entrance of a mighty
00:30:42.080 foe curse you
00:30:46.559 bail I hereby bow you will Ru this day
00:30:53.000 for we have come to hunt thee Bale your
00:30:59.200 made
00:31:04.080 fles I will riddle with hes your R
00:31:08.039 and with a hail of
00:31:10.600 harpoons with every last drop of my
00:31:16.559 being am I even supposed to be here here
00:31:19.880 we are finally fighting Bale The Dread
00:31:22.799 Twisted King of the jagged mountain or
00:31:25.559 more accurately watching Egon fight Veil
00:31:28.159 for us and he's doing a really good job
00:31:30.519 so far now if you weren't already
00:31:32.880 disregarding me as an accurate guide
00:31:35.440 then let this fight be a lesson to you
00:31:37.840 because you are definitely not supposed
00:31:39.600 to win this yet and I definitely don't
00:31:42.200 care genuinely just R dog this guy for
00:31:44.679 like 4 hours straight Mia Zaki wants the
00:31:47.519 epileptics in the audience to just die
00:31:49.240 in real life Bale the dragon has a
00:31:52.120 dreadful arsenal of attacks each one
00:31:54.200 requiring their own reactions and
00:31:56.120 responses with a cons consistently small
00:31:58.480 margin of error that will keep you
00:31:59.679 guessing for a very long boss fight and
00:32:02.519 some of the funniest damage that a
00:32:04.279 nuclear weapon is capable of including
00:32:06.679 but not limited to swipe attacks grab
00:32:09.399 attacks extremist attacks and a
00:32:12.159 significant amount of the colored orange
00:32:14.440 making for a battle that is as
00:32:15.840 beautifully chaotic as it is violently
00:32:18.200 explosive because Lord knows this boss
00:32:20.279 fight has plenty of
00:32:24.080 that you shall no f
00:32:29.000 per Egon can you like shut the [ __ ] up
00:32:31.679 soon this battle truly feels like an
00:32:34.279 epic hunt against the likes of a
00:32:36.200 terrifying Beast with a mesmerizing
00:32:38.840 barrage of blows whose haunting Splendor
00:32:40.919 can only be matched by their daunting
00:32:43.000 power especially when the majority of
00:32:45.000 attacks take out half of my health bar
00:32:47.360 they got everything right in regards to
00:32:49.279 both presentation and game playay but
00:32:51.720 what I didn't anticipate was that they
00:32:53.840 expect the same am of you putting our
00:32:55.840 patients to the ultimate test while
00:32:57.559 making for a challenge that is so good I
00:32:59.760 forgot that I handicapped myself you
00:33:02.039 know what Egon you uh you can have this
00:33:04.360 one to put it simply each moment spent
00:33:07.080 with bale The Dread is a thrilling dance
00:33:09.039 between life and death filled to the
00:33:11.320 brim with the desolation of bitter
00:33:13.120 defeat alongside the thrill of Glorious
00:33:15.840 Victory and I made sure to enjoy every
00:33:18.519 single second of it as long as it
00:33:20.799 [ __ ] takes
00:33:36.250 [Music]
00:33:51.570 [Music]
00:33:56.919 that took me tce 20 hours to make hey
00:33:59.320 there guys maxor here big fan of the
00:34:01.840 concept of music and as a result of the
00:34:04.120 deal that I made with a wizard I am
00:34:06.120 morally obligated to alert you that the
00:34:07.760 song you just heard and this song and
00:34:11.839 this song was all made by a special
00:34:14.520 artist and friend of the channel cthulu
00:34:16.879 Seeker that is a crazy composer name who
00:34:20.399 primarily makes covers that sound like
00:34:22.119 sex with Jesus
00:34:24.639 feels how is this legal to use and and
00:34:27.918 if you happen to be a fan of a game
00:34:29.359 called elen ring which you know uh maybe
00:34:33.320 then you may be interested in his entire
00:34:35.440 album of synth wve covers specifically
00:34:37.560 for this game on an actual vinyl record
00:34:39.879 and cassette tape available in the
00:34:41.918 description store now please buy it uh
00:34:44.560 it would it would sound really good if I
00:34:45.679 owned anything also he uh recently did
00:34:48.280 the exact same thing for an obscure game
00:34:50.119 called Dark Souls 3 so if you're a fan
00:34:52.918 of the music in this video and also two
00:34:55.320 previous videos take a look at cthulu
00:34:58.320 his stuff can be found in the
00:35:04.900 [Music]
00:35:11.040 description so after defeating the vile
00:35:13.680 loome Bale on behalf of the now
00:35:15.760 vaporized Captain Ahab we move on
00:35:17.880 through the spear grave Plains once
00:35:19.560 again continuing across the Great Bridge
00:35:21.680 to the Grand castle of
00:35:24.400 enes there are very nice people if you
00:35:26.720 get to know them impressive and imposing
00:35:29.480 structure standing in the path of the
00:35:31.160 shadowkey Beyond and also where I was
00:35:34.320 supposed to go in the first place but
00:35:35.880 for real this time very easy to get
00:35:38.240 distracted in this
00:35:40.110 [Music]
00:35:45.079 game cenis is a bit of a weird location
00:35:48.680 and a great way to tell new players that
00:35:50.920 it is time to stop playing now featuring
00:35:53.280 many twists and turns with the distinct
00:35:55.599 architectural Vibes of the once
00:35:57.040 populated Academy of Ral lucaria the
00:35:59.680 fate of which I am not currently aware
00:36:01.920 of except this time featuring so many
00:36:04.319 impaled corpses that it began to destroy
00:36:06.400 my computer and the 15 particle effect
00:36:08.920 throwers are not [ __ ] helping right
00:36:10.760 now here we can acquaint ourselves with
00:36:12.720 the numerous cracked out enemies strewn
00:36:14.920 about these puzzling paths as well as
00:36:17.200 the population of The Starving dog pit
00:36:19.760 every single Castle has to have one
00:36:21.839 making note of its many nuances right
00:36:24.040 before those nuances make note of us I
00:36:27.119 swear God this guy can be the final boss
00:36:28.720 of this game you know I would normally
00:36:30.520 say that this place is pretty cool but
00:36:32.480 uh then I found out that they were
00:36:34.359 redditors so unfortunately I have
00:36:36.760 resigned myself to kill everyone inside
00:36:38.359 this goddamn castle and then move on to
00:36:40.200 the next logical Target erratically
00:36:42.400 moving onwards in the vague direction of
00:36:44.359 the exit and acquainting ourselves with
00:36:46.359 the classical carrying
00:36:49.839 Hospitality I only I am allowed to heal
00:36:52.359 that that is legal we Ascend to the very
00:36:55.160 center of the dread Fortress and
00:36:56.839 consequently to the formidable twin Moon
00:37:01.130 [Music]
00:37:12.440 Knight Rana twin moonight is the very
00:37:16.000 confusingly named rude awakening for
00:37:17.720 players of all strides who in their
00:37:19.680 hubis and prde thought they would be
00:37:21.400 able to experience the game they bought
00:37:23.480 bet you're feeling pretty silly right
00:37:25.000 now this boss has every single TR TR
00:37:27.680 that you could possibly consider
00:37:29.280 difficult with extreme aggression
00:37:31.520 incredible Mobility an astonishing
00:37:34.000 amount of variation and to top it all
00:37:36.119 off just enough magic to make you feel
00:37:38.280 uncomfortable meticulously designed in
00:37:40.560 every aspect to induce an instinctive
00:37:42.560 primordial Panic response and then
00:37:45.200 immediately punish you for it with the
00:37:47.119 majority of attacks ending with an
00:37:48.480 optional combo extension which itself
00:37:50.760 can also be extended so on and so forth
00:37:54.079 like holy [ __ ] dude please relax for a
00:37:56.440 second prove it definitively that the
00:37:58.839 most threatening bosses in the game are
00:38:00.440 not dragons Giants or lions but are in
00:38:03.319 fact 9ft tall women what did Miyazaki
00:38:06.400 mean by this sorry about what happened
00:38:08.240 to your sister by the way uh and your
00:38:10.520 nieces the divorce really hit this
00:38:12.880 family hard so after a long series of
00:38:15.520 lessons on how not to be so terrible
00:38:17.400 Rana finally enters Phase 2 by buffing
00:38:19.599 herself in
00:38:21.119 the coolest way that I've ever seen
00:38:24.000 which on top of giving her an excessive
00:38:25.720 amount of fiery Fury and Magic Mings
00:38:28.079 enables her to use her ultimate
00:38:29.760 signature carry and sorcery her massive
00:38:36.560 balls yeah so this fight's going to take
00:38:38.520 me a second I have never had so much fun
00:38:40.720 getting obliterated
00:38:47.480 [Music]

00:40:18.950 [Music]
00:40:20.440 Darkness Mesmer the Impaler lies in its

00:41:11.280 a beautiful domain of Golden Glades and
00:41:13.599 horrifying Hollows punctuated
00:41:15.440 occasionally by the gigantic barar attx
00:41:18.440 because we have done a very bad job of
00:41:20.520 preventing forest fires a place well
00:41:23.040 kept within the Shadows of the Shadow
00:41:25.560 keep and most important fabled home of
00:41:28.640 the ancient and revered technique of
00:41:30.760 beating the [ __ ] out of people with your
00:41:32.240 bare hands and no I do not mean the
00:41:35.040 actual Bear Hands that is different
00:41:37.200 apparently I would genuinely be
00:41:39.480 embarrassed if I was killed by this like

00:41:55.400 this secret cave leading up us to a
00:41:58.000 secret path very very far to the east to
00:42:01.280 the extent that it is disturbing before
00:42:04.040 finally reaching the headwaters of the
00:42:05.720 Scorpion river which is seemingly called
00:42:08.119 that for no particular reason this is
00:42:11.200 the most horrifying thing I've seen in
00:42:12.760 my life and is home to a fan favorite
00:42:15.200 selection of enemies here on tour from
00:42:17.000 the Charming land of kalid yay

00:42:53.720 Max always happy to help buddy
00:42:59.559 Shadow alus is home to many a mysterious
00:43:02.319 location with some of the highlights
00:43:04.240 including such scenes is the big fort
00:43:06.319 with a giant dead body pit but to get to
00:43:09.480 my favorite location in these luminous
00:43:11.160 Landscapes we must head below the buried
00:43:13.720 ruins of Mor and emerge deep within the
00:43:16.079 confines of the very normal village with
00:43:18.480 a minor obsession with arts and crafts
00:43:20.800 second only to their obsession with
00:43:22.240 sharpening their tools as much as
00:43:24.280 humanly possible watch he's going to do
00:43:26.400 it again there go
00:43:27.760 no he's there he goes again okay he's
00:43:30.079 getting some space why sharp sharpening
00:43:32.200 the sword he's not the sharpest tool in
00:43:34.119 the shed but he's going to make sure his
00:43:35.760 sword is got to love me some of that lur
00:43:38.559 accurate kitchen
00:43:40.200 wer so after a few minutes of watching a
00:43:42.839 bunch of naked men straight up joret we
00:43:45.480 follow the bridge northwards through the
00:43:47.480 darkest forest in all of Scot Altis
00:43:49.760 dodging a series of familiar encounters
00:43:52.720 before finally finding ourselves
00:43:54.240 approaching the Cathedral of Manu met
00:43:57.500 [Music]
00:44:00.079 uh so here we have a wonderful selection
00:44:02.400 of NPC companions such as
00:44:04.520 the mentally stable man who if you so
00:44:08.160 choose leads you down an unsettling
00:44:10.440 quest line whose purpose is to reveal
00:44:12.359 the secret truth hidden just beyond the
00:44:14.640 stars eventually unveiling the dark
00:44:16.880 underlying reality sitting within the
00:44:18.920 very heart of the deformed finger
00:44:21.640 Dimension what the [ __ ] are they putting
00:44:23.640 in Japan's drinking water we also have
00:44:25.839 this cool guy named
00:44:28.240 he's Sauron it's literally just Sauron
00:44:30.880 like how am I supposed to take this
00:44:32.559 seriously so after our incredible
00:44:34.599 meeting with the finger family final
00:44:36.480 boss we decide to head to the north of
00:44:38.760 Scot alus riding through the ominous
00:44:41.040 black gate and into the very very long
00:44:43.359 tunnel before finally emerging within
00:44:45.359 the confines of the Shadow Keep Dark
00:44:48.240 Fortress of Eternal occupation
00:44:51.200 oppressive hold of Mesmer the Impaler
00:44:54.280 and specifically the very bottom of the
00:44:56.520 Shadow key
00:44:57.640 this is just like a genuinely massive
00:44:59.559 game like can I have my life back please
00:45:02.599 now Shadow keep is actually accessible
00:45:04.319 from two completely different angles the
00:45:06.839 side entrance beginning in the church
00:45:08.680 District leads both High Above This
00:45:10.440 Tower's soaring walls and down below to
00:45:12.599 a variety of beautiful and diverse Ways
00:45:15.160 to Die Each of which I will be returning
00:45:17.119 to when I remember to do them and the
00:45:19.839 main entrance starting with the Steep
00:45:21.520 Ascent leads us into the depths of the
00:45:23.559 Citadel itself but in order to access
00:45:26.079 this rambunctious route we have to first
00:45:28.119 prove ourselves against the randomly
00:45:29.960 placed hippo exhibit because no evil
00:45:32.280 Fortress is complete without one oh oh
00:45:36.000 what is that a hippo yeah they just keep
00:45:38.200 a hippo in the basketball court dude oh
00:45:40.119 never mind it's it's it's super
00:45:43.880 sonic as you can probably tell by this
00:45:46.079 point Shadow keep is not so much of a
00:45:48.119 fortress or Castle as much as it is an
00:45:51.000 insane version of lale and that was an
00:45:53.680 entire metropolitan area with numerous
00:45:56.559 comp interconnected paths leading both
00:45:58.880 outside the castle and within and
00:46:01.520 outside the castle and within again it's
00:46:05.040 a really hard to tell if you're getting
00:46:11.480 lost welcome to the evil place where all
00:46:14.079 of the bad people live as opposed to
00:46:16.000 Scot alus which only contains very nice
00:46:18.400 people in his here we can familiarize
00:46:20.440 ourselves the shadow keeps many distinct
00:46:22.720 locations and subsequently it's very
00:46:25.200 distinct residence which can range from
00:46:27.319 a series of unique and challenging fire
00:46:29.200 Knights all the way over to the
00:46:30.760 paraplegia gravity wizard riding a pig
00:46:33.319 which I thought was a pretty fun fight
00:46:35.680 and would be even more enjoyable if I
00:46:37.960 remembered how I got here every single
00:46:40.400 copy of Elden ring is personalized and
00:46:42.440 this one is trying to give me a stroke
00:46:44.800 Miyazaki intended for him to move at
00:46:46.599 that speed it is just part of the game
00:46:49.710 [Music]
00:47:01.599 rolling further onward at an appropriate
00:47:04.000 speed we progress further into the black
00:47:06.240 Bastion by ascending into the specimen
00:47:08.400 Storehouse an amazing and a loft archive
00:47:11.240 containing all of the charismatic meapa
00:47:13.079 that mury Impaler was very nice to which
00:47:16.559 is why everyone in bellot was so
00:47:18.240 welcoming to be this area is extremely
00:47:21.200 confusing almost as confusing as my
00:47:23.240 video structure with some pads guiding
00:47:25.440 us High Above This looming Library
00:47:27.480 eventually culminating in the discovery
00:47:29.240 of a secret elevator one that takes us
00:47:31.720 all the way back down to Scot alus
00:47:35.119 again so that's how I got here wild
00:47:38.559 others lead to some incredibly important
00:47:40.599 lore Revelations ah tarnished you're
00:47:43.079 finally here I have a secret plot to us
00:47:45.400 to tell you that will surely have great
00:47:48.760 godam just want to have a conversation
00:47:51.000 running the late Lord mode how would
00:47:53.839 this I [ __ ] I blame you for this
00:48:00.890 [Music]
00:48:03.400 this is it guys this is the joke that
00:48:05.200 I've been setting up the entire video
00:48:07.440 it's time for us to climb the giant feet
00:48:10.119 this is a mandatory part of the level
00:48:12.040 Miyazaki wanted this for you why are you
00:48:15.040 laughing Max oh you don't want to know
00:48:17.119 man it is a from software secret okay so
00:48:20.079 it turns out that uh the bats can't
00:48:21.680 actually hit you so long as you remain
00:48:23.559 in the fetal position the only problem
00:48:25.920 with this strategy is that um you can
00:48:28.160 never escape this is just my life
00:48:31.490 [Music]
00:48:33.880 now pot jump scare I therapy isn't
00:48:37.359 enough man he he needs to be shot
00:48:40.070 [Music]
00:49:12.480 ah the heart tarnished it seemed I'm a
00:49:17.040 snake please don't pay attention to him
00:49:19.720 who are you I'm a snake you did it again
00:49:22.960 I don't like
00:49:24.319 that but if one one so bereft and light
00:49:28.760 must know the name of his
00:49:33.400 demise then let it be so for in the
00:49:37.079 words of mother Marica was my crusade
00:49:43.559 ordained those stripped of the grace of
00:49:48.160 gold shall all meet
00:49:53.440 death in the Embrace of me
00:50:04.190 [Music]
00:50:11.319 Mesmer the Impaler Grim King of the
00:50:14.480 shadowlands and the world's most
00:50:16.440 unfortunate enzel trapped in the
00:50:18.400 darkness of his goon cave is here to
00:50:20.960 show us that those stripped of the grace
00:50:22.799 of gold shall all meet death in the
00:50:25.359 Embrace of mes Flame or so he tells us
00:50:29.040 every single time we die to him and at
00:50:31.799 this point he seems kind of Bor a it
00:50:34.520 this is the only major boss fight in the
00:50:36.240 game where the first phase is harder
00:50:38.119 than the second with most of his moves
00:50:40.040 acting as very thorough explanations
00:50:42.880 autism be damned my man can cook a
00:50:45.079 [ __ ] shishah you see on a fundamental
00:50:47.720 level Mesmer is both extremely simple
00:50:50.200 and quite complicated simple in that we
00:50:52.839 are fighting a straightforward duel with
00:50:54.760 an intuitive yet rapid move set and
00:50:57.520 complicated in that every single attack
00:50:59.359 is its own unique psychological torment
00:51:02.040 demanding and necessitating a great deal
00:51:04.280 of discipline where even the slightest
00:51:06.280 hit of panic immediately results in
00:51:08.400 death this guy just does not know when
00:51:10.960 to stop it is actually getting funny at
00:51:13.040 this point almost always engaging Us in
00:51:15.440 extremely long combos where every other
00:51:17.680 attack is laced with gunpowder but if
00:51:20.200 the player is able to dodge his
00:51:21.799 excessive Onslaught Mesmer offers
00:51:23.720 generous and ample openings sometimes in
00:51:26.280 the middle of Mix-Ups before winding up
00:51:28.240 another flurry and beginning the process
00:51:30.440 all over again which is of course
00:51:32.480 assuming that the combo is actually
00:51:34.319 going to end Mesmer you need to put that
00:51:36.680 snake away there are children here I'm a
00:51:39.200 snake shut the [ __ ] up with hilarious
00:51:42.000 belligerent and range that is not to be
00:51:44.160 underestimated combined with a large and
00:51:46.400 varying skill set this boss makes for a
00:51:48.599 fight that is as beautifully fun as it
00:51:50.280 is incredibly Sleek Mesmer has the
00:51:53.079 oppression of rala the spectacle of Bale
00:51:56.000 the good look and charm of reichart and
00:51:59.559 the smoothness of rigan all coming
00:52:01.960 together in this one ridiculous battle
00:52:04.359 that I genuinely cannot stop playing no
00:52:07.359 seriously I I would like to beat it now
00:52:09.760 combining to make more an outstanding
00:52:11.680 game of skill with a great deal to love
00:52:14.240 and one very good reason to
00:52:17.680 hate no no
00:52:20.839 no this can't be
00:52:24.440 happening I suffer Ed hundreds of
00:52:29.640 years to be king of
00:52:33.290 [Music]
00:52:40.160 Ashes oh
00:52:42.400 mother if I must be forsaken
00:52:46.559 so then forgive

00:56:04.750 [Music]
00:56:27.620 [Music]

00:00:25.840 doom eternal is a game with so much
00:00:28.080 testosterone dripping from its orifices
00:00:30.080 that it caused me to create a sun via
00:00:32.000 mitosis
00:00:32.800 in this adventure you play as john doom
00:00:35.280 a man stricken with irrationally severe
00:00:37.440 autism who does not consider or think
00:00:39.520 through his actions and effects on other
00:00:41.360 people and
00:00:42.160 in his quest to save mankind kills god
00:00:45.120 god god and
00:00:46.239 satan god god who is also himself if
00:00:49.120 this
00:00:49.440 in-depth and engaging hardcore male
00:00:51.440 gameplay sounds appealing then i've got
00:00:53.199 the game for you
00:00:54.399 this game is of course the sequel to the
00:00:56.160 critically acclaimed doom 2016 with a
00:00:58.640 few key differences
00:01:00.160 all right then buddy i'm going to
00:01:03.600 [ __ ] yourself which meaningfully extends
00:01:06.640 and builds off of the gameplay and
00:01:08.240 challenges that we love
00:01:09.520 then extends them some more off of a
00:01:11.360 [ __ ] clip until the product that
00:01:13.040 emerges out the other side resembles
00:01:14.640 crack concentrate
00:01:15.759 if you're watching this i'm assuming
00:01:17.200 you've probably played the game since i
00:01:18.880 don't actually want to help people buy
00:01:20.799 things
00:01:21.200 i'm here to entertain people and if
00:01:22.880 you're clamoring for entertainment and
00:01:24.640 haven't purchased this game yet
00:01:26.159 do yourself a favor there's enough male
00:01:28.080 hormones here to transition someone and
00:01:30.320 i can
00:01:30.799 guarantee you results my fellow sigma
00:01:33.119 males so whether you're a psychopath
00:01:35.040 like me or new to modern doom games come
00:01:37.439 with me on this amazing journey through
00:01:39.200 twitch gameplay
00:01:40.240 beautiful environments nonsensically
00:01:42.320 [ __ ] up lore and
00:01:43.439 remixed mongolian throat singing for
00:01:45.439 money is temporary
00:01:46.799 but doom is eternal
00:01:54.079 i would say that do maternal's gameplay
00:01:55.759 is quite unique and not for the reasons
00:01:57.680 that you would think
00:01:58.560 everything in do maternal is funneled
00:02:00.159 directly into a single robust
00:02:02.000 multifaceted multinational and
00:02:04.079 unilaterally combat system from which
00:02:06.159 the entire game is built around but
00:02:08.000 maxor i hear you thinking that's every
00:02:10.160 game ever yes
00:02:11.599 every good game ever if i for instance
00:02:14.000 became 12 and booted up gta 5
00:02:16.400 i would be able to do at least a dozen
00:02:18.560 unfun activities
00:02:19.840 doom's design is focused harder than the
00:02:21.599 average persona fan on his local
00:02:23.280 playground
00:02:24.000 and that is special you will play the
00:02:26.160 game in the way that is fun or you will
00:02:28.000 lose
00:02:28.400 so as good as 2016 was a polygon
00:02:30.879 journalist could beat the first half and
00:02:32.640 that's unacceptable because yes it is
00:02:34.720 actually unfun to play games after
00:02:36.400 having a lobotomy
00:02:37.360 in other games i get to choose between
00:02:39.200 things like stealth vehicles or outright
00:02:41.280 combat yet do maternal asks the question
00:02:43.599 why not force you to use every mechanic
00:02:45.920 all the time
00:02:46.720 without stopping in a world where aaa
00:02:48.879 studios try to pander to everyone it's
00:02:50.800 refreshing to have a game that sets out
00:02:52.480 to do one thing
00:02:53.519 the best and actually have developers
00:02:55.280 who give a [ __ ] about linear design and
00:02:57.360 gameplay
00:02:57.920 and the main component of that gameplay
00:02:59.760 is the arsenal because
00:03:01.120 john doom uses every weapon throughout
00:03:03.040 the game the first shotgun is used in
00:03:04.879 the last level and the last level is
00:03:06.720 used by the first shotgun when you get
00:03:08.560 an upgrade it isn't a replacement it's a
00:03:10.480 genuine addition to your arsenal
00:03:12.080 every one of them has specific uses and
00:03:13.840 yet these don't interfere at all
00:03:15.519 they enhance how do i kill an enemy well
00:03:18.159 shoot his hands off fire a rocket fire a
00:03:20.080 ballista fire flame freeze
00:03:21.519 fire fire on his freeze and throw
00:03:23.120 shotgun shotgun brain aneurysm just as
00:03:25.440 important as how you kill is how you
00:03:27.120 heal and how you restore
00:03:28.560 fortunately the aggression of this game
00:03:30.000 rivals my dog in a kindergarten like
00:03:31.840 real life the only way to get ahead of
00:03:33.360 the competition is to kill them how do i
00:03:35.360 heal when low
00:03:36.239 kill them how do i get ammo back kill
00:03:38.319 them with a chainsaw
00:03:39.680 in addition most weapons in the game
00:03:41.440 have two mods which completely change
00:03:43.120 their behavior
00:03:43.760 such stunning examples would be the
00:03:45.519 microwave beam the automatic shotgun and
00:03:47.760 the [ __ ] destroyer blade god that
00:03:49.360 shit's cool but on top of eight weapons
00:03:50.959 12 mods and a declining mental state we
00:03:53.200 keep going more than any one weapon
00:03:54.879 you'll be using your suit abilities and
00:03:56.480 they all have individual buttons
00:03:58.159 this is in addition to the eight that
00:03:59.519 you use for weapons these would be
00:04:01.040 things like zoom for fast grenade for
00:04:02.959 death swedish grenade for life punch for
00:04:05.040 no reason
00:04:05.599 and a flamethrower for armor i play
00:04:07.360 invoker and dota 2 and this [ __ ] makes
00:04:08.879 me play my keyboard like it's a [ __ ]
00:04:10.319 moonlight sonata i thoroughly recommend
00:04:12.159 playing pc and never using the weapon
00:04:13.920 wheel for maximal ritalin output and if
00:04:15.840 you can't switch weapons fast or play on
00:04:17.519 easy mode
00:04:18.399 that's fine man we're all busy how about
00:04:19.918 i give you two more buttons you thought
00:04:21.759 i was done
00:04:22.400 there's two ways to kill a demon and do
00:04:24.160 maternal the fun way or the funny way
00:04:26.560 and to maximize the funniness level we
00:04:28.800 have the crucible which is a direct
00:04:30.800 instantaneous kill on every enemy giant
00:04:33.600 area boss
00:04:34.400 dead previous area boss dead the final
00:04:37.360 boss
00:04:37.840 [ __ ] up now i hear you thinking josh
00:04:40.000 that sounds pretty strong
00:04:41.440 oh boy buckle your ass because the
00:04:43.680 second super weapon on my extensive list
00:04:45.600 of two things is the bfg
00:04:47.520 which canonically stands for big [ __ ]
00:04:50.080 gun also canonically it fires a hole
00:04:52.400 directly into the core
00:04:53.680 of mars you can't
00:05:00.479 now i could kill an enemy the long way
00:05:02.560 or i could kill him
00:05:03.840 and his dog faster than the atf at waco
00:05:06.160 it clears out everything you can see
00:05:08.080 instantly i am so thankful the game
00:05:09.919 limits how many times you can do this
00:05:11.440 now i understand that at first this may
00:05:13.120 seem
00:05:13.600 complicated but that just isn't true
00:05:15.280 because the entire game is
00:05:16.639 effectively a tutorial for hard mode and
00:05:18.720 because you're always learning as you
00:05:20.000 play it never feels stale
00:05:21.520 doom even lets you choose what stats and
00:05:23.360 runes to upgrade i spec
00:05:24.880 entirely into mobility and ammo making
00:05:27.360 my character a flimsy crack addled
00:05:29.360 spider monkey
00:05:30.240 as a side note we should release dozens
00:05:32.240 or possibly hundreds of macaques into
00:05:34.000 new york city
00:05:34.800 they can survive there why does thailand
00:05:37.039 get to keep all of the good monkeys so
00:05:38.800 what more is there to learn about doom
00:05:40.560 eternal well have you ever given thought
00:05:42.639 to the various unwashed baboons that i'm
00:05:44.720 fighting the answer
00:05:45.680 may shock you those are the others as
00:05:48.479 you may have guessed
00:05:49.280 there are at least three perhaps four
00:05:51.520 demons in the game which is a lot for
00:05:53.199 someone who is a small
00:05:54.400 blonde anime lolly such as myself but
00:05:56.720 it's the variety of the demons that make
00:05:58.319 the game interesting demons can fly they
00:06:00.560 can roll around like hedgehogs contract
00:06:02.400 obesity and be bastards who is sandy
00:06:05.039 lope
00:06:05.440 who is tsushima amy rose i didn't know
00:06:08.400 she could stand
00:06:09.440 the point of the entire game therefore
00:06:11.120 is to balance targets switch weapons and
00:06:13.039 scream internally as you repeatedly fail
00:06:15.039 to be cool just like high school what
00:06:16.800 i'm getting at is every game that has
00:06:18.240 completely different behavior and goals
00:06:19.919 from one another the doom hunter rolls
00:06:21.600 around in a comically small
00:06:23.199 tank the zombies like us exist to die
00:06:25.919 and the marauder produces controversy he
00:06:28.400 does a lot of damage blocks your attacks
00:06:30.240 fights you at wild speeds and can only
00:06:32.160 be attacked after blatantly signaling so
00:06:34.319 i personally have no issue with him as i
00:06:36.080 find the challenge fun and engaging and
00:06:38.000 if you don't i'm not saying you're wrong
00:06:39.759 i'm saying you're bad i'm not getting
00:06:41.360 into the details for each one
00:06:42.720 since that's not funny but don't worry
00:06:44.639 there are 27 of them
00:06:46.240 without dlc and if you're wondering why
00:06:48.400 i'm fighting the entire cast of dante's
00:06:50.319 inferno you're actually
00:06:51.599 the minority this game tries at every
00:06:53.360 moment to make exposition
00:06:54.639 collectible why is there just a [ __ ]
00:06:56.960 big spear in the planet and why is
00:06:58.720 heaven comprised entirely of moth people
00:07:01.039 you cannot stop the procession
00:07:05.280 it feels like one guy wrote the events
00:07:06.960 of the game and another guy invented lsd
00:07:09.280 just to write the backstory so i'm going
00:07:11.039 to combine both of them into a single
00:07:12.960 accurate interpretation of the doom lore
00:07:15.120 if i say something
00:07:16.000 objectionable just pretend that it's
00:07:17.759 right
00:07:24.720 one brazilian years ago there was a guy
00:07:26.800 named the dad who was effectively god
00:07:28.880 and he made moths in lamp heaven called
00:07:30.880 the makers
00:07:31.520 every ten thousand years all moths
00:07:33.360 combine their collective consciousness
00:07:34.960 into one
00:07:35.599 giga moth called the con maker who is
00:07:37.759 the moth pope so the moths rule over the
00:07:39.599 galaxy sort of until earth happens and
00:07:41.520 then we start [ __ ] everything up
00:07:42.960 the moth pope finds john doom after a
00:07:44.800 spree of murders and he explains to her
00:07:46.479 that yes
00:07:47.120 hell exists it's weird that humans knew
00:07:49.280 about hell before god
00:07:50.720 anyways the moth pope after finding out
00:07:52.479 that hell is real very reasonably
00:07:54.160 decides to sacrifice a planet to it see
00:07:56.479 it turns out that god literally pieced
00:07:58.400 the [ __ ] out like 10 million years ago
00:08:00.319 and let them off do whatever they wanted
00:08:01.840 so now the con maker cannot be replaced
00:08:03.840 and cannot die so she sort of goes
00:08:05.360 insane from the constant immortality now
00:08:07.199 the plan is to get some of that sweet
00:08:08.800 hell energy by repeatedly sacrificing
00:08:10.720 entire planets to the dark lord in
00:08:12.560 exchange for it meanwhile a sentient
00:08:14.479 robot named samuel hayden is very busy
00:08:16.720 on mars
00:08:17.360 earth has this problem called climate
00:08:18.960 change and we need to find a new energy
00:08:20.720 source so instead of something hard and
00:08:22.639 difficult like
00:08:23.440 solar power samuel hayden is like what
00:08:25.280 if we extract this cool
00:08:26.639 blue energy from hell also it's on mars
00:08:31.120 earth does this until hell begins
00:08:32.719 breaking into mars and john doom stops
00:08:34.719 them which is the plot of doom 2016.
00:08:36.719 this makes samuel hayden mad because
00:08:38.399 he's funded by the koch brothers and
00:08:39.919 really doesn't want to build a windmill
00:08:41.519 so instead of destroying the demonic
00:08:43.039 crucible he just brings it back to earth
00:08:44.720 and catapults john doom into the
00:08:46.160 backstory planet if you think that
00:08:47.760 sounds unreasonable just remember that
00:08:49.440 we considered blotting out the sun
00:08:50.959 before building a [ __ ] solar panel
00:08:57.600 unsurprisingly demons invade to recycle
00:09:00.000 earth into blue energy for the moth pope
00:09:01.920 so john doom has to fight both catholics
00:09:04.160 and hell and as you go through the game
00:09:06.000 you might notice that it just brings up
00:09:07.519 random [ __ ] at will
00:09:08.640 like oh sorry the soul factory is being
00:09:10.800 held there by two gigantic titans and
00:09:12.800 it's like
00:09:13.200 okay i guess attack on titan is real now
00:09:15.760 doomslayer you'll need this knife to
00:09:17.440 kill my son oh [ __ ] what do you do
00:09:21.360 the plot of the main game to understate
00:09:23.360 it is psychotic
00:09:24.480 and acts as an increasing checklist of
00:09:26.320 galactically convoluted tasks just in
00:09:28.560 this one game
00:09:29.440 john doom finds an ancient city like
00:09:31.360 three times goes to the north pole to
00:09:33.279 kill santa
00:09:34.160 fights croatia does a little trolling
00:09:36.399 does a little [ __ ] fighting
00:09:37.920 invades heaven and permanently kills god
00:09:40.560 but we'll get back to that doom 2016
00:09:42.560 took place on mars but this game has you
00:09:44.720 slung around the universe on a [ __ ]
00:09:46.399 bungee cord so i understand completely
00:09:48.399 when people say they don't play doom
00:09:49.920 eternal for the plot they're just wrong
00:09:51.920 i play doom eternal for the plot and
00:09:54.080 that might sound strange to you but
00:09:55.680 eternal's plot is
00:09:56.800 pure insanity and it does everything
00:09:58.560 that it needs to we are painfully aware
00:10:00.640 that the plot exists as a contrivance
00:10:02.399 because the environmental designer went
00:10:04.000 [ __ ] ballistic i just don't care i
00:10:05.920 played every single level gleefully
00:10:07.760 wondering
00:10:08.320 oh boy what stupid [ __ ] is next i cannot
00:10:10.959 [ __ ] wait
00:10:11.760 so play the game for the plot it is
00:10:13.920 integral to the experience of doom
00:10:15.519 eternal
00:10:16.000 open max or there's a plot hole how did
00:10:17.839 the doom slayer get the first
00:10:19.279 everything i've said so far except some
00:10:21.120 of it applies in full partially to the
00:10:23.040 base game but there's
00:10:24.160 40 dollar reduce of dlc where the
00:10:26.240 gameplay is faster the challenge harder
00:10:28.480 and the plot
00:10:29.200 somehow even [ __ ] worse in all the
00:10:31.120 right departments 2016 was a walk
00:10:33.279 eternal is usain bolt and the ancient
00:10:35.279 gods is [ __ ] venezuelan inflation you
00:10:37.360 thought it was over when john doom beat
00:10:39.040 the demons and destroyed all of heaven
00:10:40.720 but you were wrong
00:10:41.760 that's just the beginning and with both
00:10:43.519 parts of the dlc now fully out my
00:10:45.600 recommendation cannot be understated
00:10:47.360 let's get into why and more importantly
00:10:49.519 what
00:10:55.360 this section of the video is going to be
00:10:57.040 different far more structural and
00:10:58.480 aligned with the plot of the dlc
00:11:00.160 because the gameplay isn't what's new
00:11:01.680 about the product it's the challenge and
00:11:03.279 the story i originally wrote an entire
00:11:05.200 script for this and then trashed it
00:11:06.640 because it doesn't truly communicate how
00:11:08.320 this dlc drove me to insanity and i hard
00:11:10.640 cope by simping for 2d women i will tell
00:11:12.560 you if there's a very big gameplay
00:11:14.000 change but the point of the dlc is more
00:11:15.920 of what's amazing if you like doom a
00:11:17.519 turtle you will like the dlc
00:11:19.360 period okay so samuel hayden you might
00:11:21.440 know him for his various appearances on
00:11:22.959 political youtube debates advocating for
00:11:24.800 carbon positivity it turns out that he's
00:11:27.040 not a robot he's a [ __ ] angel also
00:11:29.519 john dooms alexa is god that's not a
00:11:31.680 joke or exaggeration his name is vega
00:11:33.760 and he is the physical remnant of god's
00:11:35.839 consciousness in ai form so samuel now a
00:11:38.480 [ __ ] divine being wants you to revive
00:11:40.560 him since both god and satan are trapped
00:11:42.959 in volleyballs
00:11:43.839 at this point the video can't count as
00:11:45.360 spoilers because it makes no [ __ ]
00:11:47.040 sense
00:11:47.440 the first dlc is essentially trolling
00:11:49.360 because you kill god
00:11:50.800 why well obviously to revive satan
00:11:53.440 exclusively so you can fight him what
00:11:55.279 could go
00:11:55.680 wrong a particular note here on the
00:11:57.600 gameplay side is the final boss who is
00:11:59.839 samuel hayden because holy [ __ ] this
00:12:01.920 fight is hard also the premise is
00:12:03.519 ridiculous and my enjoyment of the game
00:12:05.120 is hurt by neither every aspect of this
00:12:07.040 is speedy
00:12:07.760 fun and everything else i've already
00:12:09.519 said about the game in general and when
00:12:11.200 you finally beat samuel and revive the
00:12:12.959 dark lord it
00:12:13.839 turns out he's you yeah the only thing
00:12:17.360 in the world that could possibly kill
00:12:19.120 john doom
00:12:22.839 himself
00:12:33.920 so now the not you you decides to go to
00:12:36.079 hell where we all belong and the second
00:12:37.760 dlc is just chasing him this is of
00:12:39.600 course where the testosterone moves into
00:12:41.279 critical levels
00:12:42.160 how does one get to the capital city of
00:12:44.079 hell well that's a great question first
00:12:46.000 of all go to the planet of argentineur
00:12:48.320 light the bat signal learn how to train
00:12:50.399 your dragon okay go into the giant spear
00:12:52.800 that pierces the entire planet for some
00:12:54.639 reason get the key to the gate
00:12:56.959 now go back to earth traverse the last
00:12:58.800 of us two and find the gate of diluma
00:13:00.880 but before i get to the final showdown
00:13:02.480 with crash bandicoot twinsanity there's
00:13:04.480 some cool gameplay i want to talk
00:13:06.000 about you have a [ __ ] hammer in this
00:13:07.680 dlc primarily used to defy the laws of
00:13:09.839 gravity but secondarily gives you
00:13:11.519 everything in the game
00:13:12.480 health no problem ammo absolutely my
00:13:15.279 deepest darkest urges
00:13:16.720 yes as i used this i became more
00:13:18.560 obsessed with hammers than bob the
00:13:19.920 [ __ ] builder and there's plenty of
00:13:21.440 demons to use it on since the dlc has a
00:13:23.600 shitload of reskins for instance the
00:13:25.519 spirit is a congealed amphetamine mass
00:13:27.519 that makes every infested target three
00:13:29.040 times faster microsoft pinball who is
00:13:31.279 fun to fight i promise
00:13:32.639 and the blood makers they are my
00:13:35.600 original
00:13:36.320 oc do not steal it so now that we've
00:13:38.880 reached cleveland it's time for the dlc
00:13:40.800 to gain
00:13:41.440 style this is the culmination of all of
00:13:43.839 our work the final battle against satan
00:13:46.000 himself
00:13:46.720 and holy [ __ ] you can feel it when the
00:13:48.800 sentinel army shows up and everyone's
00:13:50.399 ready to kick ass you just can't help
00:13:51.920 but feel like your dick is being tickled
00:13:53.440 cleveland lives up to the hype too
00:13:55.040 for once because it's a non-stop battle
00:13:56.959 of epic proportions right up until the
00:13:58.639 final boss
00:13:59.440 this is a universe which implicitly
00:14:01.199 acknowledges your god-like power by
00:14:02.959 making the only credible threat to you
00:14:04.880 your identical twin with red eyes in a
00:14:07.040 gun though that is called [ __ ]
00:14:08.560 gameplay and it's a beautiful send-off
00:14:10.480 right up until the man himself who
00:14:12.000 awkwardly waddles around the arena like
00:14:13.760 a penguin but that's fine the fight is
00:14:15.440 still cool
00:14:18.639 wow you know it's so sad that steve jobs
00:14:20.720 died with pigma who the hell is steve
00:14:23.199 jobs got him
00:14:27.600 now before we defenestrate there's a few
00:14:29.600 details i want to talk about that truly
00:14:31.440 complete this game make it a real 10 out
00:14:33.199 of good
00:14:33.680 firstly i would classify the music of
00:14:35.440 this game as metal without guitars and i
00:14:37.920 [ __ ] dig it
00:14:38.880 so much how do you make metal without a
00:14:40.560 guitar well you sample mongolian throat
00:14:42.639 singing and your lawnmower
00:14:45.839 it just sounds so good normally music
00:14:48.000 isn't very important but
00:14:49.360 it's so good that it becomes important
00:14:51.279 and the role it plays in setting your
00:14:52.639 mood is vital also the main composer
00:14:54.880 mick gordon like v
00:14:56.320 watches virtual youtubers every waking
00:14:58.320 second of his day great minds think
00:15:00.000 alike
00:15:00.480 in fact most of the music in this video
00:15:02.399 is just do maternal soundtrack guess
00:15:04.160 you'll have to re-watch it over and over
00:15:06.000 again to really listen
00:15:13.440 finally this game looks really good not
00:15:15.600 in the oh wow look at all these
00:15:16.959 particles i'm stroking out way
00:15:18.639 it's more like how does literally anyone
00:15:20.399 have time to model all of the geometry
00:15:22.160 in the game it is unreal
00:15:23.279 it is so downright inspired that it
00:15:25.040 makes you feel bad while playing it doom
00:15:26.880 eternal is such a fast and
00:15:28.160 pulse-pounding game that it's like
00:15:29.440 sprinting through the [ __ ] lube
00:15:30.880 how am i supposed to appreciate the mona
00:15:32.399 lisa when it looks like this should you
00:15:34.160 buy the game yes
00:15:35.199 i am very biased if speed and action is
00:15:37.360 what you crave and you want to induce
00:15:38.880 cardiac arrest early
00:15:40.079 this is your game i would like to thank
00:15:41.680 the demonic brotherhood funding this
00:15:43.199 channel in exchange for their souls

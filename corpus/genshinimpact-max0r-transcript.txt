00:00:00.000 this video is a cry for help gentian
00:00:02.760 impact is a playable anime and that's
00:00:04.440 pretty good since my videos are attempts
00:00:06.000 to make watchable anime I can't believe
00:00:08.039 it guys they made a sequel to Stockholm
00:00:10.080 syndrome welcome to the world of tevat
00:00:12.059 you may have heard of it from all the
00:00:13.380 free advertising that I'm doing a
00:00:15.000 beautiful post-apocalyptic nightmare
00:00:16.680 World featuring a giant tree
00:00:18.779 sorry that's the wrong game on our
00:00:20.820 journey throughout the Seven Nations we
00:00:22.439 will meet the world's most colorful cast
00:00:23.939 of children entrusted and empowered by
00:00:25.980 the gods to wield Elemental energy as
00:00:27.840 dangerously as possible I'm just a big
00:00:29.820 fan of the characters in this game there
00:00:31.320 is no reason in particular assemble your
00:00:33.420 team of heroic Psychopaths and begin
00:00:35.100 blasting boating cooking your enemies
00:00:37.380 alive visiting baby's first casino and
00:00:39.540 with enough time it will become baby's
00:00:41.160 last casino but most importantly have
00:00:43.200 fun because the game will try to stop
00:00:44.640 you I can assure you that the visual
00:00:46.200 novels are exactly what dahway intended
00:00:48.059 so join me as I navigate one of the most
00:00:50.160 beautiful Fantastical and expensive game
00:00:52.379 worlds ever made one agonizing country
00:00:54.300 at a time this is it guys this is what
00:00:56.340 900 million dollars can buy you are you
00:00:58.440 having fun yet look all I'm trying to
00:01:00.180 say is of this is a weird episode of Eva
00:01:04.559 into the sky
00:01:18.439 can you hear
00:01:21.970 [Music]
00:01:28.680 wow I haven't been here enough two years
00:01:35.460 welcome back to monstat and yes the game
00:01:37.619 still displays your IP address just in
00:01:39.420 case you're a little bit too critical
00:01:40.979 this place is where the player learns
00:01:42.659 how to fight who learns how to kill the
00:01:44.100 innocent animals learns that they are
00:01:45.659 bisexual as soon as they see Kaio so I
00:01:47.759 think it's a great opportunity to teach
00:01:49.020 the basics and uh nothing else the
00:01:50.939 environment here looks like a chair is a
00:01:52.320 polygon I think a good place to start is
00:01:53.939 with our team the if you were going to
00:01:55.680 Saria official every crew got the
00:01:57.479 schizophrenic personality disorder
00:01:59.220 mentally and physically deranged wife
00:02:01.200 material I'm serious about that there's
00:02:03.360 a quest where you enter her mind and she
00:02:04.799 fights her tulpa end user license
00:02:06.420 agreement literally the only physical
00:02:08.038 DPS possibly racist has the biggest
00:02:10.440 Slappy in tevot thank goodness
00:02:13.040 [ __ ] and Rosaria who was dressed
00:02:15.540 promiscuously so we need to cover her up
00:02:17.160 in appropriate garments God I wish nuns
00:02:19.140 were real with our team assembled we are
00:02:20.760 now able to do nothing because I have to
00:02:22.319 explain the game against impact is a
00:02:24.120 based character RPG where each character
00:02:25.980 wields one of the Seven Elements all of
00:02:27.840 them interacting completely
00:02:28.980 nonsensically water bus fire ice freezes
00:02:31.319 water plants above the electricity the
00:02:33.239 [ __ ] gas leak danger requires nine
00:02:35.099 tabs in Khan Academy my team is based on
00:02:37.440 not playing the game as much as possible
00:02:38.879 there is genuinely no cooldown to freeze
00:02:40.739 by the way what I'm showing you now is
00:02:42.239 considered tame the game is actually
00:02:43.800 supposed to look sub mentally deranged
00:02:45.360 the numbers are helping me to understand
00:02:46.680 what's happening of course some
00:02:48.300 characters are bad and others are very
00:02:50.099 bad but many are absolutely game
00:02:52.019 changing there are characters that
00:02:53.340 straight up allow me to fly at least
00:02:54.900 throughout regular means this one fights
00:02:57.060 with the pogo stick and this one doesn't
00:02:58.620 fight at all my Cox crit rate is
00:03:00.300 negative 87. the game also allows us to
00:03:02.640 choose from a lot of weapons I think I
00:03:04.620 have a few copies each one with their
00:03:06.360 own properties and sub stats is
00:03:08.040 sometimes in too many sub stats like God
00:03:09.900 damn I'm fighting with a Wikipedia page
00:03:11.400 we've got bows Spears paddles Big Fish
00:03:14.400 sent you to Umbrella child's bomb
00:03:16.500 instructions I hope you can see why
00:03:18.000 there's a lot of variation and also
00:03:19.440 Theory crafting a lot of Chinese Theory
00:03:21.360 grafting did they take this game very
00:03:23.040 seriously like right outside of a KFC
00:03:25.080 seriously and if you're wondering about
00:03:26.459 the gambling well hell we'll get to it
00:03:28.379 later I have a lot to say about it but
00:03:30.780 for now welcome to the land of the Animo
00:03:33.180 God who is a twink that gets kicked in
00:03:34.800 the balls
00:03:39.680 this guy's uh really jamming out no chat
00:03:42.900 I'm not going to do that yoinky Swanky
00:03:44.519 oh my God he just doesn't give a [ __ ] so
00:03:46.500 what if I just uh oh no you can't be
00:03:49.379 stopped well I guess if he can't beat
00:03:50.819 him monsat is a depopulated Anarchist
00:03:53.159 state where there are no taxes no police
00:03:55.560 and half the country is controlled by
00:03:57.239 wolves wolves that you up never actually
00:03:59.040 see unless you want to count razor I
00:04:00.720 mean there's the giant wolf but he's
00:04:02.159 kind of special
00:04:04.019 I what the dog doing as a result of this
00:04:07.080 nobody in Montana has any money except
00:04:09.420 for the Church of course the city is
00:04:10.799 undergoing a crippling wine epidemic
00:04:12.480 look I just think it's a serious funding
00:04:14.099 issue when the Cavalry Captain doesn't
00:04:15.420 have a horse therefore most of your time
00:04:17.220 is going to be spent cleaning up their
00:04:18.600 mess with their singular mess because
00:04:20.579 there is only one enemy in monstadt yes
00:04:22.620 from the beautiful ruins of old to the
00:04:24.180 peaks of dragon spine 90 of the enemies
00:04:26.100 you encounter are illiterals a sentient
00:04:28.380 race capable of empathy and complex
00:04:29.940 thoughts which is why they must be
00:04:31.560 destroyed literally take a random
00:04:33.180 location in monstad you aren't 10
00:04:34.860 seconds away from a Hiller Turtle why is
00:04:36.660 that one unbirthing itself really cool
00:04:38.340 that the only organization of monstat is
00:04:40.199 dedicated to race war they even have
00:04:41.880 their own language which I'm being
00:04:43.320 quizzed on honestly I'm a bit of a yay
00:04:45.180 daughter man myself really feeling that
00:04:46.860 muhu yay today don't say Nini Zito it's
00:04:49.139 basically a slur they didn't like that
00:04:51.360 look what I'm trying to say is this
00:04:52.860 place has problems but ultimately they
00:04:54.720 are cool problems monstat may not be
00:04:56.580 that varied well designed or even have a
00:04:58.740 story that I can't summarize in one
00:05:00.060 sentence the dragon was beaned and then
00:05:02.460 he was nice Sun Tzu ultimately this is
00:05:05.759 just the beginning of a long long
00:05:07.440 journey this game is planned out up
00:05:09.240 seven years in advance so as far as the
00:05:11.280 basics go there is no better teacher
00:05:13.080 than monster but uh pretty much just the
00:05:15.120 basics I don't think I'm staying for the
00:05:16.560 boss fights
00:05:18.360 I did what is happening what the [ __ ] am
00:05:20.699 I seeing
00:05:27.510 [Music]
00:05:29.280 okay can you stop playing for a sec no
00:05:32.600 I need to go to my teapot
00:05:42.140 [Music]
00:05:43.740 for the next stop on our war crimes tour
00:05:45.720 for Balkans we're heading to the
00:05:47.280 funigation post about this nation day
00:05:49.020 instantly gain Reddit Karma and for that
00:05:50.820 we're going to need to climb as high as
00:05:52.020 we can so we can deduce the direction
00:05:55.080 so we're going to this location on the
00:05:56.880 map if only there was a better way to
00:05:58.500 view the world make sure to land on the
00:06:00.120 elevator next we're going to uh
00:06:02.699 we're going to uh
00:06:04.860 one second we're going to ascend to
00:06:06.539 space either way why does that work like
00:06:09.660 that oh my God the planet's receding I
00:06:12.120 am alone in this hell on Earth
00:06:14.880 I think I'm uh I think I'm gonna be here
00:06:17.400 for a little bit you know what's real
00:06:18.840 bad when the moon is physically below
00:06:20.220 you hang on guys it's getting kind of
00:06:21.660 dark so I'm just gonna change the time
00:06:23.220 real quick yeah the game lets you do
00:06:24.780 that well folks it was nice knowing you
00:06:26.759 all
00:06:29.280 never mind
00:06:32.050 [Music]
00:06:36.919 Hey guys Maxwell here and welcome to uh
00:06:39.960 China it's just China
00:06:45.199 I really hope I didn't just tank my
00:06:47.460 social Credit in our previous of
00:06:49.139 Adventures we explored monster to learn
00:06:50.880 the basic mechanics and also um race
00:06:52.979 relations so for leeway we're going to
00:06:55.020 learn that we've been playing the game
00:06:56.400 wrong but before I can get to that I
00:06:58.319 need to explain my team I call it the a
00:07:00.300 hot shower by force Lord knows we need
00:07:02.039 it
00:07:04.400 yes this is a man I know it's hard to
00:07:06.960 tell he is also ridiculously broken on
00:07:08.880 account of his ability to make enemies
00:07:10.440 wet interpret that information however
00:07:12.060 you want hootau is the owner of a
00:07:13.919 funeral parlor and she could use a bit
00:07:15.479 of new business if she is also the
00:07:16.919 winner of the most terrifying Sims award
00:07:18.720 like the thread just doesn't end he's
00:07:20.520 still writing them most reasonable hotel
00:07:22.440 main yalad is a character that I play
00:07:24.360 for the personality she is also one of
00:07:26.940 the most overpowered units in the game
00:07:28.199 because she's the second show I don't
00:07:30.360 even care that she's a federal psyop I
00:07:32.580 can fix her and Toba who is the [ __ ]
00:07:35.160 spelled wrong just a just just don't
00:07:37.199 build Toba with our team assembled we're
00:07:39.000 now able to trivialize the combat
00:07:40.620 because this team is ridiculous but
00:07:42.060 fortunately Genji is not just a game
00:07:43.560 about combat it's a game about gambling
00:07:45.599 you see Genji impact is what we call a
00:07:47.639 gotcha game because it has got me in its
00:07:49.500 grasp which means that the primary game
00:07:51.060 mechanic is Chance every character is
00:07:53.039 Chance every weapon is Chance every
00:07:55.139 piece of every build is [ __ ] chance
00:07:56.819 do you know what it's like to have a
00:07:58.380 mathematically impossible goblet God
00:07:59.940 damn eliting hey so I see you're trying
00:08:01.560 to level up your crit rate wow that's a
00:08:04.080 weird way to spell defense but
00:08:05.340 fortunately we can predict the outcomes
00:08:06.780 of our character roles using some
00:08:07.979 Eastern philosophies and the answer is
00:08:10.319 um 105 on average but don't worry you've
00:08:13.199 got a lot of time uh I I guess we're
00:08:15.240 gonna wait a day
00:08:16.750 [Music]
00:08:18.979 because only a few five stars are
00:08:21.240 actually available and sometimes they
00:08:22.860 aren't available for 483 days she is in
00:08:25.740 prison for racism but what are they
00:08:27.539 going to do lock me up
00:08:34.440 at any cost and there's a few ways to do
00:08:36.719 that you could Explore More go on
00:08:38.640 Fantastic Adventures or find amazing
00:08:40.979 Treasures if you want to stay poor no
00:08:43.260 you see the real money is made in the
00:08:44.940 daily quests which are a series of
00:08:46.800 useful and normal missions such as
00:08:48.360 talking to people murdering those people
00:08:50.220 talking to the hill of Charles very
00:08:52.080 nicely of finding the weasel where do
00:08:54.660 you go and jumping on mushrooms who the
00:08:57.000 [ __ ] if I should be to do this we also
00:08:58.560 have the power to send various
00:08:59.640 characters on 20-hour Expeditions
00:09:01.620 directly to the coal mines look guys I
00:09:04.080 really need these 2 000 upgrade
00:09:05.399 materials it's just uh best you don't
00:09:07.200 think about it too hard greetings travel
00:09:09.560 okay what can I do for you today yeah
00:09:12.120 I'd like to uh send a child to the coal
00:09:13.980 mines put her in for 20 hours for
00:09:15.779 travelers she's going to die lithium is
00:09:17.760 not going to mine itself Catherine but
00:09:19.680 do not question me Catherine or I'll
00:09:21.480 have you stabbed in a future quests
00:09:23.440 [Music]
00:09:30.720 anyway is an authoritarian militaristic
00:09:32.940 oligarchy controlled by a committee of
00:09:34.680 really hot lesbians I believe in God you
00:09:36.779 Supremacy this nation is the land of
00:09:38.700 contracts and by entering you have made
00:09:40.620 the contract to not criticize this stage
00:09:42.180 consequently leeway is also aware of all
00:09:44.160 money is printed on the planet so uh I
00:09:46.140 guess monstat's economy is powered by
00:09:47.459 hopes and dreams and also uh the card
00:09:49.380 game look Timmy I know your dad's dead
00:09:51.060 and all but do you want to play gwent A
00:09:53.279 Minor side effect of this is that Lee
00:09:54.779 weighs in the midst of a violent crime
00:09:56.339 epidemic as in the majority of enemies
00:09:58.140 in leeway are human and even worse
00:10:00.300 they're poor they're so poor in fact
00:10:02.100 that they're forced to fight you with
00:10:03.060 Molotov cocktails and farming equipment
00:10:04.800 what is what is your plan my guy the
00:10:07.440 masculine urge to Dig a Hole by the way
00:10:09.240 we're the good guys speaking of digging
00:10:11.279 holes I should probably address this
00:10:13.260 it's a little difficult to ignore you
00:10:15.240 see there are many beautiful places to
00:10:16.800 see in leeway such as night City the
00:10:19.200 [ __ ] rice fields the most annoying
00:10:21.360 place to navigate on the earth like
00:10:22.740 please stop giving me commissions here
00:10:24.240 and then we have the chasm which is a
00:10:26.459 secret underground Labyrinth containing
00:10:28.080 all of the game's Eldritch Horrors and
00:10:29.519 yes this is just to the chasm
00:10:34.220 yeah there's no sound effect for that if
00:10:36.480 you die down here no one will hear your
00:10:38.100 screams as soon as you think you're done
00:10:39.720 exploring it just it just keeps going
00:10:41.279 down the devs had to add Moon shoes to
00:10:43.200 the game so I could keep playing it now
00:10:44.700 that we're trapped down here we only
00:10:46.320 have two options remaining we need to
00:10:47.880 mine and we need to craft
00:10:50.279 the second part will come later okay so
00:10:53.160 now it's later unfortunately I cannot
00:10:54.839 craft a sense of humor look what I'm
00:10:56.279 trying to say is leeway is a very
00:10:57.779 diverse place it's certainly more
00:10:58.980 diverse than a hilltroll field number
00:11:00.720 six but most importantly leeway is a
00:11:02.820 land of questions what Secrets lie in
00:11:04.620 this mysterious land what Adventures are
00:11:06.839 still to be had am I gay now it's almost
00:11:09.480 enough to make you forget the nightmare
00:11:10.800 pit and look leeway might have a few
00:11:12.779 issues with organized crime sea monster
00:11:14.820 attacks it happens twice and the
00:11:16.740 landscape always trying to kill me but
00:11:18.180 hey at least the story's up it's okay
00:11:20.339 can anyone can anyone here tell me why
00:11:22.200 why like there's a why there's like a
00:11:24.180 giant bird next to me it's weird oh [ __ ]
00:11:26.880 where am I I'm diagonally
00:11:29.640 foreign
00:11:32.620 [Music]
00:11:49.580 [Music]
00:12:02.360 okay guys listen we need to reach Japan
00:12:04.740 don't worry I have a plan to bypass the
00:12:06.720 vacation we are going to walk there yes
00:12:09.180 that's right we're going to excuse me
00:12:11.519 we're going to travel underneath the
00:12:12.839 ocean so apparently I just have to um
00:12:14.579 uh-huh
00:12:17.760 that actually worked okay I think I've
00:12:19.740 uh made a mistake it's time to descend
00:12:21.839 into the Abyssal Zone and just to watch
00:12:23.700 out for the void uh what do I do about
00:12:25.980 this so I think I've been walking for uh
00:12:27.959 20 minutes
00:12:30.600 I don't like this anymore okay we're
00:12:32.579 pretty close now so uh
00:12:34.440 I don't think we're close enough please
00:12:36.000 no please no please no
00:12:38.420 we're drowning there
00:12:40.360 [Music]
00:12:48.019 what is up my fadies and gentle mems
00:12:50.820 welcome to the land of Inazuma a home to
00:12:52.920 nobody because no one is probably housed
00:12:54.660 in need as well previously monsant
00:12:56.519 taught us how to play and Lee Wade and
00:12:58.079 taught us how to sip well the light of
00:12:59.700 lighting is here to teach us that we
00:13:00.839 have not felt true pain yet but first
00:13:02.519 let's go over our team which I will be
00:13:04.320 calling the uh yandere benzos yabiko
00:13:07.200 mommy sorry Sigma female kidnapped a man
00:13:09.779 and forced feminized him God I wish that
00:13:11.579 was me Graveler I'm making a call out
00:13:13.320 post to my twitter.com what the [ __ ] are
00:13:15.180 you saying I'm gonna piss on the [ __ ]
00:13:16.740 Moon Bruce you can literally name him
00:13:18.779 Bruce that is actually how it appears in
00:13:20.639 game in fact we could name him all kinds
00:13:22.500 of things such as baby girl Dr ligma
00:13:25.220 ball fart testicles what is that and
00:13:28.740 last but not least
00:13:30.139 Hatsune Miku this is literally just Miku
00:13:32.940 like they didn't even try to hide it and
00:13:34.800 Bennett who is the single most
00:13:36.480 overpowered unit in the game like
00:13:37.980 genshin doesn't have power creep because
00:13:39.540 of Bennett send this [ __ ] to the coal
00:13:41.220 mines and have his testicles exploded
00:13:42.660 now my previous teams they were kind of
00:13:44.579 nice but this time I'm not playing nice
00:13:46.440 I'm playing for funny numbers every
00:13:48.300 single member is optimized beyond the
00:13:49.740 boundaries of reason I rolled six copies
00:13:51.600 of Hatsune Miku and now I can kill
00:13:53.040 tortellini in two attacks get up and
00:13:54.899 costs 50 also Bruce can up the fly like
00:13:57.540 actual flight it breaks like half the
00:13:59.160 game's AI when you do it they're just
00:14:00.600 very good views my entire team is him
00:14:02.279 shooting down at the peasants like an
00:14:03.480 attack helicopter just uh don't ask me
00:14:05.399 how long I found for this I had to grind
00:14:07.200 for this View
00:14:10.920 foreign
00:14:16.279 she's wearing socks in the water there's
00:14:18.660 something is horribly wrong with this
00:14:19.920 country
00:14:21.500 itazuma is a third world isolationist
00:14:23.880 dictatorship mostly occupied by
00:14:25.560 catastrophic disasters both natural and
00:14:27.720 man-made but mostly man-made me and the
00:14:29.940 Fellas watching Oppenheimer in the IMAX
00:14:31.560 itazuma is also engulfed in a
00:14:33.180 decades-long civil war resulting in mass
00:14:35.220 unemployment at a refugee crisis
00:14:36.899 naturally this is reflected in the enemy
00:14:38.820 variety because to visit evazubas to be
00:14:40.920 accosted by the hundreds of jacked
00:14:42.480 homeless people like these guys just
00:14:43.920 stand in the rain all day how do the
00:14:45.480 hilly turtles have more shelter than
00:14:46.560 this it is also a land of many islands
00:14:48.540 which all act as their own individual
00:14:50.160 insurgencies so I think this is a great
00:14:52.260 opportunity to educate you as to why you
00:14:54.060 should never visit idah Zuma you know
00:14:55.560 besides uh the [ __ ] puzzles this [ __ ]
00:14:57.540 is the work of Satan naragami island is
00:14:59.579 the only place in Inazuma resembling a
00:15:01.380 civilization the rest is basically just
00:15:03.060 Martin Luther King Boulevard the only
00:15:04.680 disaster this island has to worry about
00:15:06.180 is the government and her name is the
00:15:07.980 Ryden Shogun kanazuka is the first
00:15:09.720 island to be made uninhabitable by
00:15:11.279 nuclear weapons testing which then
00:15:12.720 proceeds to leak out of the elephant's
00:15:14.160 foot in an amount so dangerous it makes
00:15:15.660 Chernobyl look like clam College I mean
00:15:17.519 I guess there's also the Cujo encampment
00:15:19.079 but uh we don't go to the gujoun gamut
00:15:22.680 well that's enough of that
00:15:24.720 wait a minute
00:15:26.480 what the [ __ ]
00:15:29.899 Yash Yori is an absolute Nightmare on
00:15:32.459 account of the non-stop lightning storm
00:15:34.079 end up slightly imposing giant skull my
00:15:36.600 favorite activity is up going to this
00:15:38.040 place it limits the land the lightning
00:15:39.660 can strike so it just [ __ ] whacks you
00:15:41.519 looks like another beautiful day in the
00:15:42.959 great Lane of Inazuma of course I could
00:15:44.820 fix the problem if I wanted to but when
00:15:46.440 I began the quest to remove the
00:15:47.579 lightning I was struck by it I'm gonna
00:15:49.440 take that as a sign from God say right
00:15:51.300 island is what happens when Mr Beast
00:15:52.920 donates 50 megatons of ionizing
00:15:54.660 radiation to families to be like this
00:15:56.519 [ __ ] makes Evangelion look like a comedy
00:15:58.199 special the fact that there aren't even
00:15:59.399 homeless people here probably tells you
00:16:01.079 all you need to know sarumi island is a
00:16:03.360 very isolated Place populated for
00:16:05.100 thousands of years by bird worshiping
00:16:06.839 Savages who need their mineral resources
00:16:08.459 exploited President Biden please send
00:16:10.199 Raytheon missile so I can buy Dasani
00:16:11.880 water and Cheetos I just think it has
00:16:13.440 something to do with the up
00:16:14.839 interdimensional Dog watatsumi Island is
00:16:17.339 really nice like what the [ __ ] does this
00:16:20.100 even count as an island it's just so
00:16:21.839 beautiful I sure hope it's not hiding
00:16:23.399 some kind of horrifying Dark Secret
00:16:26.480 thank you
00:16:28.260 oh economia is you [ __ ] Atlantis you
00:16:31.620 get there by jumping into the giant hole
00:16:33.000 and it's like how is this legal are the
00:16:34.860 developers okay that this place was once
00:16:36.720 home to a thriving civilization which
00:16:38.459 collapsed nearly instantly after they
00:16:39.959 discovered Tick Tock it also allows me
00:16:41.639 to toggle the powers of the artificial
00:16:43.320 sun and uh the holy [ __ ] this 5G
00:16:45.420 connection is crazy look I think you've
00:16:47.339 got the idea at this point as much as
00:16:48.899 I've talked about reactions enough
00:16:50.160 children again should impact at its core
00:16:52.259 is an exploration game because it makes
00:16:53.940 you explore your sexuality and that fact
00:16:55.740 alone makes Xena Zuma one of the best
00:16:57.300 areas if you don't count the story
00:16:58.980 please kill me mommy I've been a bad boy
00:17:00.839 and okay this nation might be lacking in
00:17:02.820 housing basic infrastructure and some
00:17:04.679 unbombed land but honestly that's just
00:17:06.660 part of The Rustic charms how else do
00:17:08.459 you think this island got a giant crater
00:17:09.720 just uh be glad you don't have to live
00:17:11.339 in eatonzibar it's all fun and games
00:17:13.140 until you piss off the geometry

00:17:46.919 to do that all we have to do is not be
00:17:48.960 stuck in need of Zuma so if you were a
00:17:50.580 fan of our undersea Adventure then don't
00:17:52.559 worry this glitch is much worse all

00:18:39.900 the land of Sumeria sumeru hittite
00:18:42.299 jumpscare the only nation against an
00:18:44.400 impact that can use the internet mostly
00:18:46.020 for racism good to see that nothing's
00:18:47.700 changed it is also absurdly gigantic
00:18:49.860 like the map screen can't even see all
00:18:51.360 of it but before we can get into the
00:18:53.100 intricacies of Sumerian society I have
00:18:55.260 to explain my team the uh the
00:18:57.419 kindergarten Nikita is I can explain my
00:19:00.660 girl will attend but she is 10. Nikita
00:19:03.120 is the literal god of knowledge if you
00:19:04.740 count knowledge as the personal thoughts
00:19:06.299 of every NPC in sumero which she can
00:19:08.400 read even when I log into Discord
00:19:09.840 there's no escaping her oh my [ __ ]
00:19:11.640 God they're still typing it how many
00:19:13.380 e-books do these people have
00:19:16.200 because watching you count as a hobby
00:19:18.900 what I've actually been watching you for
00:19:21.120 a long time excuse me what nilu has a
00:19:23.640 completely Hollow skull and there is
00:19:25.080 nothing happening inside her head she
00:19:26.760 could not pass an eye exam the second
00:19:28.320 will be a Coco wait a minute I've seen
00:19:30.660 you before but fellas I've got something
00:19:32.280 to admit you see kokabi's damage scales
00:19:34.500 on health for her healing skills and
00:19:36.120 health and yes even her health scales on
00:19:38.100 health so naturally when it came time to
00:19:39.780 build her I am use the wrong stat it
00:19:41.700 makes the numbers funnier yao yao is
00:19:43.860 very cute and Buddy her playstyle is
00:19:46.020 chill and relaxing in fact you don't
00:19:48.059 even have to play as Yao you play as her

00:19:52.140 vegetables at them how many people would
00:19:53.700 you kill for Yow is not the right
00:19:55.380 question the right question is how many
00:19:57.000 people I would allow to live personally
00:19:58.740 I think this team is really good for not
00:20:00.600 having a DPS and we are going to need it
00:20:02.460 for all the funny and interesting events
00:20:04.260 this game has to offer because dear
00:20:06.059 viewer I lied to you the best way to
00:20:08.160 make money is not actually the weasel
00:20:09.720 mini game it is participating in
00:20:11.400 temporary event content which I can only
00:20:13.200 describe as punishment for developers
00:20:14.640 who are too insane event contents such
00:20:16.620 as prop hunt a game where you disguise
00:20:18.539 yourselves as various household items to
00:20:20.220 escape the wrath of very stupid people
00:20:22.020 oh God I think he's got a whiff wow guys

00:21:12.059 most money just uh don't look up any of

00:21:33.500 okay you gotta watch out buddy you're
00:21:35.640 you're [ __ ] you're rolling too much
00:21:39.500 sumero is an autocratic orwellian
00:21:41.820 surveillance state with a little hint of
00:21:43.559 apartheid governed by the worst
00:21:45.240 organization imaginable University this
00:21:48.000 nation is the land of knowledge with
00:21:49.559 most of it being devoted to new more
00:21:51.299 efficient ways to be racist and to that
00:21:53.280 end sumera was segregated between two
00:21:55.740 distinct Parts each with their own
00:21:57.120 unique ways to kill you the forest is a
00:21:59.400 terrifying Safari hellscape where each
00:22:01.080 animal is not only able to kill you but
00:22:02.760 is evolved to we've got Tigers cows
00:22:05.159 crocodiles robot dinosaur fungus
00:22:07.860 dinosaur welcome to Jurassic Park and my
00:22:11.520 favorite animal type poor people but
00:22:13.559 most importantly the forest is where the
00:22:15.240 white people live and they're filling
00:22:16.440 the library with video essays this is
00:22:18.600 the Academia who controls severo by
00:22:20.580 spreading misinformation on the internet
00:22:22.020 Ryden the Academia doesn't want you to
00:22:24.120 know this but you can steal Ducks from
00:22:25.679 the public park the are free righted the
00:22:28.140 desert is a desolate abandoned Wasteland
00:22:30.059 once home to a thriving civilization
00:22:31.740 before the caucasoids built a giant wall
00:22:33.900 between them does does anyone else think
00:22:35.640 this is weird we've got scorpions we've
00:22:37.620 got Scorpi outs welcome to Jurassic hell
00:22:40.440 we've got the uh
00:22:42.080 never mind so is he gonna like uh
00:22:45.500 okay and we've got worm demons but my
00:22:48.900 personal favorite obstacle is definitely
00:22:50.280 the gigantic [ __ ] off laser there are of
00:22:52.860 course even more enemies but most of
00:22:54.360 them are just liberal propaganda to make
00:22:56.100 you believe that race mixing is a
00:22:57.419 physical need and fellas it's working
00:22:59.280 but hey the desert isn't all that bad as
00:23:01.740 long as you ignore the racist Genie
00:23:03.360 Quest the [ __ ] graduated from
00:23:04.799 casual to competitive racism all right
00:23:06.840 later Max what
00:23:08.940 wait I gotta go AFK real quick no you
00:23:12.419 can't do this to me look the point is
00:23:14.580 Subaru is massive and it's not even done
00:23:16.919 and also leeway isn't done and also
00:23:19.380 monstad but what sumero does have is an
00:23:21.900 actually good story like out of all the
00:23:23.640 things I expected Harvard building and
00:23:25.200 Evangelion was not one of them
00:23:30.120 you can't tell me what to do anymore Mom
00:23:32.340 I'm finally inside of another man
00:23:35.059 I am the all-knowing god Jesus Christ
00:23:38.940 they really made this boss fight a
00:23:40.679 mobile game by the way so whether you're
00:23:42.419 exploring deep in the woods at 4am
00:23:44.159 finding amazing Oasis God I sure hope
00:23:46.740 nothing Whimsical happens here I'm
00:23:48.659 fighting more minorities I'm trying to
00:23:50.640 be a police officer or doing the eight
00:23:52.620 hour gnome people Quest that is a that
00:23:55.260 is a lot of side quests there will
00:23:56.820 always be a new surprise in sumero and
00:23:58.740 the future content is even a fraction as
00:24:00.480 good as this then I'm going to be
00:24:01.679 playing this game for a very long time

00:00:27.840 dangerously as possible I'm just a big
00:00:29.820 fan of the characters in this game there
00:00:31.320 is no reason in particular assemble your
00:00:33.420 team of heroic Psychopaths and begin
00:00:35.100 blasting boating cooking your enemies
00:00:37.380 alive visiting baby's first casino and
00:00:39.540 with enough time it will become baby's
00:00:41.160 last casino but most importantly have
00:00:43.200 fun because the game will try to stop
00:00:44.640 you I can assure you that the visual
00:00:46.200 novels are exactly what dahway intended
00:00:48.059 so join me as I navigate one of the most
00:00:50.160 beautiful Fantastical and expensive game
00:00:52.379 worlds ever made one agonizing country
00:00:54.300 at a time this is it guys this is what
00:00:56.340 900 million dollars can buy you are you
00:00:58.440 having fun yet look all I'm trying to
00:01:00.180 say is of this is a weird episode of Eva
00:01:04.559 into the sky
00:01:18.439 can you hear
00:01:21.970 [Music]
00:01:28.680 wow I haven't been here enough two years
00:01:35.460 welcome back to monstat and yes the game
00:01:37.619 still displays your IP address just in
00:01:39.420 case you're a little bit too critical
00:01:40.979 this place is where the player learns
00:01:42.659 how to fight who learns how to kill the
00:01:44.100 innocent animals learns that they are
00:01:45.659 bisexual as soon as they see Kaio so I
00:01:47.759 think it's a great opportunity to teach
00:01:49.020 the basics and uh nothing else the
00:01:50.939 environment here looks like a chair is a
00:01:52.320 polygon I think a good place to start is
00:01:53.939 with our team the if you were going to
00:01:55.680 Saria official every crew got the
00:01:57.479 schizophrenic personality disorder
00:01:59.220 mentally and physically deranged wife
00:02:01.200 material I'm serious about that there's
00:02:03.360 a quest where you enter her mind and she
00:02:04.799 fights her tulpa end user license
00:02:06.420 agreement literally the only physical
00:02:08.038 DPS possibly racist has the biggest
00:02:10.440 Slappy in tevot thank goodness
00:02:13.040 [ __ ] and Rosaria who was dressed
00:02:15.540 promiscuously so we need to cover her up
00:02:17.160 in appropriate garments God I wish nuns
00:02:19.140 were real with our team assembled we are
00:02:20.760 now able to do nothing because I have to
00:02:22.319 explain the game against impact is a
00:02:24.120 based character RPG where each character
00:02:25.980 wields one of the Seven Elements all of
00:02:27.840 them interacting completely
00:02:28.980 nonsensically water bus fire ice freezes
00:02:31.319 water plants above the electricity the
00:02:33.239 [ __ ] gas leak danger requires nine
00:02:35.099 tabs in Khan Academy my team is based on
00:02:37.440 not playing the game as much as possible
00:02:38.879 there is genuinely no cooldown to freeze
00:02:40.739 by the way what I'm showing you now is
00:02:42.239 considered tame the game is actually
00:02:43.800 supposed to look sub mentally deranged
00:02:45.360 the numbers are helping me to understand
00:02:46.680 what's happening of course some
00:02:48.300 characters are bad and others are very
00:02:50.099 bad but many are absolutely game
00:02:52.019 changing there are characters that
00:02:53.340 straight up allow me to fly at least
00:02:54.900 throughout regular means this one fights
00:02:57.060 with the pogo stick and this one doesn't
00:02:58.620 fight at all my Cox crit rate is
00:03:00.300 negative 87. the game also allows us to
00:03:02.640 choose from a lot of weapons I think I
00:03:04.620 have a few copies each one with their
00:03:06.360 own properties and sub stats is
00:03:08.040 sometimes in too many sub stats like God
00:03:09.900 damn I'm fighting with a Wikipedia page
00:03:11.400 we've got bows Spears paddles Big Fish
00:03:14.400 sent you to Umbrella child's bomb
00:03:16.500 instructions I hope you can see why
00:03:18.000 there's a lot of variation and also
00:03:19.440 Theory crafting a lot of Chinese Theory
00:03:21.360 grafting did they take this game very
00:03:23.040 seriously like right outside of a KFC
00:03:25.080 seriously and if you're wondering about
00:03:26.459 the gambling well hell we'll get to it
00:03:28.379 later I have a lot to say about it but
00:03:30.780 for now welcome to the land of the Animo
00:03:33.180 God who is a twink that gets kicked in
00:03:34.800 the balls
00:03:39.680 this guy's uh really jamming out no chat
00:03:42.900 I'm not going to do that yoinky Swanky
00:03:44.519 oh my God he just doesn't give a [ __ ] so
00:03:46.500 what if I just uh oh no you can't be
00:03:49.379 stopped well I guess if he can't beat
00:03:50.819 him monsat is a depopulated Anarchist
00:03:53.159 state where there are no taxes no police
00:03:55.560 and half the country is controlled by
00:03:57.239 wolves wolves that you up never actually
00:03:59.040 see unless you want to count razor I
00:04:00.720 mean there's the giant wolf but he's
00:04:02.159 kind of special
00:04:04.019 I what the dog doing as a result of this
00:04:07.080 nobody in Montana has any money except
00:04:09.420 for the Church of course the city is
00:04:10.799 undergoing a crippling wine epidemic
00:04:12.480 look I just think it's a serious funding
00:04:14.099 issue when the Cavalry Captain doesn't
00:04:15.420 have a horse therefore most of your time
00:04:17.220 is going to be spent cleaning up their
00:04:18.600 mess with their singular mess because
00:04:20.579 there is only one enemy in monstadt yes
00:04:22.620 from the beautiful ruins of old to the
00:04:24.180 peaks of dragon spine 90 of the enemies
00:04:26.100 you encounter are illiterals a sentient
00:04:28.380 race capable of empathy and complex
00:04:29.940 thoughts which is why they must be
00:04:31.560 destroyed literally take a random
00:04:33.180 location in monstad you aren't 10
00:04:34.860 seconds away from a Hiller Turtle why is
00:04:36.660 that one unbirthing itself really cool
00:04:38.340 that the only organization of monstat is
00:04:40.199 dedicated to race war they even have
00:04:41.880 their own language which I'm being
00:04:43.320 quizzed on honestly I'm a bit of a yay
00:04:45.180 daughter man myself really feeling that
00:04:46.860 muhu yay today don't say Nini Zito it's
00:04:49.139 basically a slur they didn't like that
00:04:51.360 look what I'm trying to say is this
00:04:52.860 place has problems but ultimately they
00:04:54.720 are cool problems monstat may not be
00:04:56.580 that varied well designed or even have a
00:04:58.740 story that I can't summarize in one
00:05:00.060 sentence the dragon was beaned and then
00:05:02.460 he was nice Sun Tzu ultimately this is
00:05:05.759 just the beginning of a long long
00:05:07.440 journey this game is planned out up
00:05:09.240 seven years in advance so as far as the
00:05:11.280 basics go there is no better teacher
00:05:13.080 than monster but uh pretty much just the
00:05:15.120 basics I don't think I'm staying for the
00:05:16.560 boss fights
00:05:18.360 I did what is happening what the [ __ ] am
00:05:20.699 I seeing
00:05:27.510 [Music]
00:05:29.280 okay can you stop playing for a sec no
00:05:32.600 I need to go to my teapot
00:05:42.140 [Music]
00:05:43.740 for the next stop on our war crimes tour
00:05:45.720 for Balkans we're heading to the
00:05:47.280 funigation post about this nation day
00:05:49.020 instantly gain Reddit Karma and for that
00:05:50.820 we're going to need to climb as high as
00:05:52.020 we can so we can deduce the direction
00:05:55.080 so we're going to this location on the
00:05:56.880 map if only there was a better way to
00:05:58.500 view the world make sure to land on the
00:06:00.120 elevator next we're going to uh
00:06:02.699 we're going to uh
00:06:04.860 one second we're going to ascend to
00:06:06.539 space either way why does that work like
00:06:09.660 that oh my God the planet's receding I
00:06:12.120 am alone in this hell on Earth
00:06:14.880 I think I'm uh I think I'm gonna be here
00:06:17.400 for a little bit you know what's real
00:06:18.840 bad when the moon is physically below
00:06:20.220 you hang on guys it's getting kind of
00:06:21.660 dark so I'm just gonna change the time
00:06:23.220 real quick yeah the game lets you do
00:06:24.780 that well folks it was nice knowing you
00:06:26.759 all
00:06:29.280 never mind
00:06:32.050 [Music]
00:06:36.919 Hey guys Maxwell here and welcome to uh
00:06:39.960 China it's just China
00:06:45.199 I really hope I didn't just tank my
00:06:47.460 social Credit in our previous of
00:06:49.139 Adventures we explored monster to learn
00:06:50.880 the basic mechanics and also um race
00:06:52.979 relations so for leeway we're going to
00:06:55.020 learn that we've been playing the game
00:06:56.400 wrong but before I can get to that I
00:06:58.319 need to explain my team I call it the a
00:07:00.300 hot shower by force Lord knows we need
00:07:02.039 it
00:07:04.400 yes this is a man I know it's hard to
00:07:06.960 tell he is also ridiculously broken on
00:07:08.880 account of his ability to make enemies
00:07:10.440 wet interpret that information however
00:07:12.060 you want hootau is the owner of a
00:07:13.919 funeral parlor and she could use a bit
00:07:15.479 of new business if she is also the
00:07:16.919 winner of the most terrifying Sims award
00:07:18.720 like the thread just doesn't end he's
00:07:20.520 still writing them most reasonable hotel
00:07:22.440 main yalad is a character that I play
00:07:24.360 for the personality she is also one of
00:07:26.940 the most overpowered units in the game
00:07:28.199 because she's the second show I don't
00:07:30.360 even care that she's a federal psyop I
00:07:32.580 can fix her and Toba who is the [ __ ]
00:07:35.160 spelled wrong just a just just don't
00:07:37.199 build Toba with our team assembled we're
00:07:39.000 now able to trivialize the combat
00:07:40.620 because this team is ridiculous but
00:07:42.060 fortunately Genji is not just a game
00:07:43.560 about combat it's a game about gambling
00:07:45.599 you see Genji impact is what we call a
00:07:47.639 gotcha game because it has got me in its
00:07:49.500 grasp which means that the primary game
00:07:51.060 mechanic is Chance every character is
00:07:53.039 Chance every weapon is Chance every
00:07:55.139 piece of every build is [ __ ] chance
00:07:56.819 do you know what it's like to have a
00:07:58.380 mathematically impossible goblet God
00:07:59.940 damn eliting hey so I see you're trying
00:08:01.560 to level up your crit rate wow that's a
00:08:04.080 weird way to spell defense but
00:08:05.340 fortunately we can predict the outcomes
00:08:06.780 of our character roles using some
00:08:07.979 Eastern philosophies and the answer is
00:08:10.319 um 105 on average but don't worry you've
00:08:13.199 got a lot of time uh I I guess we're
00:08:15.240 gonna wait a day
00:08:16.750 [Music]
00:08:18.979 because only a few five stars are
00:08:21.240 actually available and sometimes they
00:08:22.860 aren't available for 483 days she is in
00:08:25.740 prison for racism but what are they
00:08:27.539 going to do lock me up
00:08:34.440 at any cost and there's a few ways to do
00:08:36.719 that you could Explore More go on
00:08:38.640 Fantastic Adventures or find amazing
00:08:40.979 Treasures if you want to stay poor no
00:08:43.260 you see the real money is made in the
00:08:44.940 daily quests which are a series of
00:08:46.800 useful and normal missions such as
00:08:48.360 talking to people murdering those people
00:08:50.220 talking to the hill of Charles very
00:08:52.080 nicely of finding the weasel where do
00:08:54.660 you go and jumping on mushrooms who the
00:08:57.000 [ __ ] if I should be to do this we also
00:08:58.560 have the power to send various
00:08:59.640 characters on 20-hour Expeditions
00:09:01.620 directly to the coal mines look guys I
00:09:04.080 really need these 2 000 upgrade
00:09:05.399 materials it's just uh best you don't
00:09:07.200 think about it too hard greetings travel
00:09:09.560 okay what can I do for you today yeah
00:09:12.120 I'd like to uh send a child to the coal
00:09:13.980 mines put her in for 20 hours for
00:09:15.779 travelers she's going to die lithium is
00:09:17.760 not going to mine itself Catherine but
00:09:19.680 do not question me Catherine or I'll
00:09:21.480 have you stabbed in a future quests
00:09:23.440 [Music]
00:09:30.720 anyway is an authoritarian militaristic
00:09:32.940 oligarchy controlled by a committee of
00:09:34.680 really hot lesbians I believe in God you
00:09:36.779 Supremacy this nation is the land of
00:09:38.700 contracts and by entering you have made
00:09:40.620 the contract to not criticize this stage
00:09:42.180 consequently leeway is also aware of all
00:09:44.160 money is printed on the planet so uh I
00:09:46.140 guess monstat's economy is powered by
00:09:47.459 hopes and dreams and also uh the card
00:09:49.380 game look Timmy I know your dad's dead
00:09:51.060 and all but do you want to play gwent A
00:09:53.279 Minor side effect of this is that Lee
00:09:54.779 weighs in the midst of a violent crime
00:09:56.339 epidemic as in the majority of enemies
00:09:58.140 in leeway are human and even worse
00:10:00.300 they're poor they're so poor in fact
00:10:02.100 that they're forced to fight you with
00:10:03.060 Molotov cocktails and farming equipment
00:10:04.800 what is what is your plan my guy the
00:10:07.440 masculine urge to Dig a Hole by the way
00:10:09.240 we're the good guys speaking of digging
00:10:11.279 holes I should probably address this
00:10:13.260 it's a little difficult to ignore you
00:10:15.240 see there are many beautiful places to
00:10:16.800 see in leeway such as night City the
00:10:19.200 [ __ ] rice fields the most annoying
00:10:21.360 place to navigate on the earth like
00:10:22.740 please stop giving me commissions here
00:10:24.240 and then we have the chasm which is a
00:10:26.459 secret underground Labyrinth containing
00:10:28.080 all of the game's Eldritch Horrors and
00:10:29.519 yes this is just to the chasm
00:10:34.220 yeah there's no sound effect for that if
00:10:36.480 you die down here no one will hear your
00:10:38.100 screams as soon as you think you're done
00:10:39.720 exploring it just it just keeps going
00:10:41.279 down the devs had to add Moon shoes to
00:10:43.200 the game so I could keep playing it now
00:10:44.700 that we're trapped down here we only
00:10:46.320 have two options remaining we need to
00:10:47.880 mine and we need to craft
00:10:50.279 the second part will come later okay so
00:10:53.160 now it's later unfortunately I cannot
00:10:54.839 craft a sense of humor look what I'm
00:10:56.279 trying to say is leeway is a very
00:10:57.779 diverse place it's certainly more
00:10:58.980 diverse than a hilltroll field number
00:11:00.720 six but most importantly leeway is a
00:11:02.820 land of questions what Secrets lie in
00:11:04.620 this mysterious land what Adventures are
00:11:06.839 still to be had am I gay now it's almost
00:11:09.480 enough to make you forget the nightmare
00:11:10.800 pit and look leeway might have a few
00:11:12.779 issues with organized crime sea monster
00:11:14.820 attacks it happens twice and the
00:11:16.740 landscape always trying to kill me but
00:11:18.180 hey at least the story's up it's okay
00:11:20.339 can anyone can anyone here tell me why
00:11:22.200 why like there's a why there's like a
00:11:24.180 giant bird next to me it's weird oh [ __ ]
00:11:26.880 where am I I'm diagonally
00:11:29.640 foreign
00:11:32.620 [Music]
00:11:49.580 [Music]
00:12:02.360 okay guys listen we need to reach Japan
00:12:04.740 don't worry I have a plan to bypass the
00:12:06.720 vacation we are going to walk there yes
00:12:09.180 that's right we're going to excuse me
00:12:11.519 we're going to travel underneath the
00:12:12.839 ocean so apparently I just have to um
00:12:14.579 uh-huh
00:12:17.760 that actually worked okay I think I've
00:12:19.740 uh made a mistake it's time to descend
00:12:21.839 into the Abyssal Zone and just to watch
00:12:23.700 out for the void uh what do I do about
00:12:25.980 this so I think I've been walking for uh
00:12:27.959 20 minutes
00:12:30.600 I don't like this anymore okay we're
00:12:32.579 pretty close now so uh
00:12:34.440 I don't think we're close enough please
00:12:36.000 no please no please no
00:12:38.420 we're drowning there

00:13:18.779 Bruce that is actually how it appears in
00:13:20.639 game in fact we could name him all kinds
00:13:22.500 of things such as baby girl Dr ligma
00:13:25.220 ball fart testicles what is that and
00:13:28.740 last but not least
00:13:30.139 Hatsune Miku this is literally just Miku
00:13:32.940 like they didn't even try to hide it and
00:13:34.800 Bennett who is the single most
00:13:36.480 overpowered unit in the game like
00:13:37.980 genshin doesn't have power creep because
00:13:39.540 of Bennett send this [ __ ] to the coal
00:13:41.220 mines and have his testicles exploded
00:13:42.660 now my previous teams they were kind of
00:13:44.579 nice but this time I'm not playing nice
00:13:46.440 I'm playing for funny numbers every
00:13:48.300 single member is optimized beyond the
00:13:49.740 boundaries of reason I rolled six copies
00:13:51.600 of Hatsune Miku and now I can kill
00:13:53.040 tortellini in two attacks get up and
00:13:54.899 costs 50 also Bruce can up the fly like
00:13:57.540 actual flight it breaks like half the
00:13:59.160 game's AI when you do it they're just
00:14:00.600 very good views my entire team is him
00:14:02.279 shooting down at the peasants like an
00:14:03.480 attack helicopter just uh don't ask me
00:14:05.399 how long I found for this I had to grind
00:14:07.200 for this View
00:14:10.920 foreign
00:14:16.279 she's wearing socks in the water there's
00:14:18.660 something is horribly wrong with this
00:14:19.920 country
00:14:21.500 itazuma is a third world isolationist
00:14:23.880 dictatorship mostly occupied by
00:14:25.560 catastrophic disasters both natural and
00:14:27.720 man-made but mostly man-made me and the
00:14:29.940 Fellas watching Oppenheimer in the IMAX
00:14:31.560 itazuma is also engulfed in a
00:14:33.180 decades-long civil war resulting in mass
00:14:35.220 unemployment at a refugee crisis
00:14:36.899 naturally this is reflected in the enemy
00:14:38.820 variety because to visit evazubas to be
00:14:40.920 accosted by the hundreds of jacked
00:14:42.480 homeless people like these guys just
00:14:43.920 stand in the rain all day how do the
00:14:45.480 hilly turtles have more shelter than
00:14:46.560 this it is also a land of many islands
00:14:48.540 which all act as their own individual
00:14:50.160 insurgencies so I think this is a great
00:14:52.260 opportunity to educate you as to why you
00:14:54.060 should never visit idah Zuma you know
00:14:55.560 besides uh the [ __ ] puzzles this [ __ ]
00:14:57.540 is the work of Satan naragami island is
00:14:59.579 the only place in Inazuma resembling a
00:15:01.380 civilization the rest is basically just
00:15:03.060 Martin Luther King Boulevard the only
00:15:04.680 disaster this island has to worry about
00:15:06.180 is the government and her name is the
00:15:07.980 Ryden Shogun kanazuka is the first
00:15:09.720 island to be made uninhabitable by
00:15:11.279 nuclear weapons testing which then
00:15:12.720 proceeds to leak out of the elephant's
00:15:14.160 foot in an amount so dangerous it makes
00:15:15.660 Chernobyl look like clam College I mean
00:15:17.519 I guess there's also the Cujo encampment
00:15:19.079 but uh we don't go to the gujoun gamut
00:15:22.680 well that's enough of that
00:15:24.720 wait a minute
00:15:26.480 what the [ __ ]
00:15:29.899 Yash Yori is an absolute Nightmare on
00:15:32.459 account of the non-stop lightning storm
00:15:34.079 end up slightly imposing giant skull my
00:15:36.600 favorite activity is up going to this
00:15:38.040 place it limits the land the lightning
00:15:39.660 can strike so it just [ __ ] whacks you
00:15:41.519 looks like another beautiful day in the
00:15:42.959 great Lane of Inazuma of course I could
00:15:44.820 fix the problem if I wanted to but when
00:15:46.440 I began the quest to remove the
00:15:47.579 lightning I was struck by it I'm gonna
00:15:49.440 take that as a sign from God say right
00:15:51.300 island is what happens when Mr Beast
00:15:52.920 donates 50 megatons of ionizing
00:15:54.660 radiation to families to be like this
00:15:56.519 [ __ ] makes Evangelion look like a comedy
00:15:58.199 special the fact that there aren't even
00:15:59.399 homeless people here probably tells you
00:16:01.079 all you need to know sarumi island is a
00:16:03.360 very isolated Place populated for
00:16:05.100 thousands of years by bird worshiping
00:16:06.839 Savages who need their mineral resources
00:16:08.459 exploited President Biden please send
00:16:10.199 Raytheon missile so I can buy Dasani
00:16:11.880 water and Cheetos I just think it has
00:16:13.440 something to do with the up
00:16:14.839 interdimensional Dog watatsumi Island is
00:16:17.339 really nice like what the [ __ ] does this
00:16:20.100 even count as an island it's just so
00:16:21.839 beautiful I sure hope it's not hiding
00:16:23.399 some kind of horrifying Dark Secret
00:16:26.480 thank you
00:16:28.260 oh economia is you [ __ ] Atlantis you
00:16:31.620 get there by jumping into the giant hole
00:16:33.000 and it's like how is this legal are the
00:16:34.860 developers okay that this place was once
00:16:36.720 home to a thriving civilization which
00:16:38.459 collapsed nearly instantly after they
00:16:39.959 discovered Tick Tock it also allows me
00:16:41.639 to toggle the powers of the artificial
00:16:43.320 sun and uh the holy [ __ ] this 5G
00:16:45.420 connection is crazy look I think you've
00:16:47.339 got the idea at this point as much as
00:16:48.899 I've talked about reactions enough
00:16:50.160 children again should impact at its core
00:16:52.259 is an exploration game because it makes
00:16:53.940 you explore your sexuality and that fact
00:16:55.740 alone makes Xena Zuma one of the best
00:16:57.300 areas if you don't count the story
00:16:58.980 please kill me mommy I've been a bad boy
00:17:00.839 and okay this nation might be lacking in
00:17:02.820 housing basic infrastructure and some
00:17:04.679 unbombed land but honestly that's just
00:17:06.660 part of The Rustic charms how else do
00:17:08.459 you think this island got a giant crater
00:17:09.720 just uh be glad you don't have to live
00:17:11.339 in eatonzibar it's all fun and games
00:17:13.140 until you piss off the geometry

00:17:50.580 fan of our undersea Adventure then don't

00:18:39.900 the land of Sumeria sumeru hittite
00:18:42.299 jumpscare the only nation against an
00:18:44.400 impact that can use the internet mostly
00:18:46.020 for racism good to see that nothing's
00:18:47.700 changed it is also absurdly gigantic
00:18:49.860 like the map screen can't even see all
00:18:51.360 of it but before we can get into the
00:18:53.100 intricacies of Sumerian society I have
00:18:55.260 to explain my team the uh the
00:18:57.419 kindergarten Nikita is I can explain my
00:19:00.660 girl will attend but she is 10. Nikita
00:19:03.120 is the literal god of knowledge if you
00:19:04.740 count knowledge as the personal thoughts
00:19:06.299 of every NPC in sumero which she can
00:19:08.400 read even when I log into Discord
00:19:09.840 there's no escaping her oh my [ __ ]
00:19:11.640 God they're still typing it how many
00:19:13.380 e-books do these people have
00:19:16.200 because watching you count as a hobby
00:19:18.900 what I've actually been watching you for
00:19:21.120 a long time excuse me what nilu has a
00:19:23.640 completely Hollow skull and there is
00:19:25.080 nothing happening inside her head she
00:19:26.760 could not pass an eye exam the second
00:19:28.320 will be a Coco wait a minute I've seen
00:19:30.660 you before but fellas I've got something
00:19:32.280 to admit you see kokabi's damage scales
00:19:34.500 on health for her healing skills and
00:19:36.120 health and yes even her health scales on
00:19:38.100 health so naturally when it came time to
00:19:39.780 build her I am use the wrong stat it
00:19:41.700 makes the numbers funnier yao yao is
00:19:43.860 very cute and Buddy her playstyle is
00:19:46.020 chill and relaxing in fact you don't
00:19:48.059 even have to play as Yao you play as her

00:19:52.140 vegetables at them how many people would
00:19:53.700 you kill for Yow is not the right
00:19:55.380 question the right question is how many
00:19:57.000 people I would allow to live personally
00:19:58.740 I think this team is really good for not
00:20:00.600 having a DPS and we are going to need it
00:20:02.460 for all the funny and interesting events
00:20:04.260 this game has to offer because dear
00:20:06.059 viewer I lied to you the best way to
00:20:08.160 make money is not actually the weasel
00:20:09.720 mini game it is participating in
00:20:11.400 temporary event content which I can only
00:20:13.200 describe as punishment for developers
00:20:14.640 who are too insane event contents such
00:20:16.620 as prop hunt a game where you disguise
00:20:18.539 yourselves as various household items to
00:20:20.220 escape the wrath of very stupid people
00:20:22.020 oh God I think he's got a whiff wow guys

00:21:12.059 most money just uh don't look up any of

00:21:33.500 okay you gotta watch out buddy you're
00:21:35.640 you're [ __ ] you're rolling too much
00:21:39.500 sumero is an autocratic orwellian
00:21:41.820 surveillance state with a little hint of
00:21:43.559 apartheid governed by the worst
00:21:45.240 organization imaginable University this
00:21:48.000 nation is the land of knowledge with
00:21:49.559 most of it being devoted to new more
00:21:51.299 efficient ways to be racist and to that
00:21:53.280 end sumera was segregated between two
00:21:55.740 distinct Parts each with their own
00:21:57.120 unique ways to kill you the forest is a
00:21:59.400 terrifying Safari hellscape where each
00:22:01.080 animal is not only able to kill you but
00:22:02.760 is evolved to we've got Tigers cows
00:22:05.159 crocodiles robot dinosaur fungus
00:22:07.860 dinosaur welcome to Jurassic Park and my
00:22:11.520 favorite animal type poor people but
00:22:13.559 most importantly the forest is where the
00:22:15.240 white people live and they're filling
00:22:16.440 the library with video essays this is
00:22:18.600 the Academia who controls severo by
00:22:20.580 spreading misinformation on the internet
00:22:22.020 Ryden the Academia doesn't want you to
00:22:24.120 know this but you can steal Ducks from
00:22:25.679 the public park the are free righted the
00:22:28.140 desert is a desolate abandoned Wasteland
00:22:30.059 once home to a thriving civilization
00:22:31.740 before the caucasoids built a giant wall
00:22:33.900 between them does does anyone else think
00:22:35.640 this is weird we've got scorpions we've
00:22:37.620 got Scorpi outs welcome to Jurassic hell
00:22:40.440 we've got the uh
00:22:42.080 never mind so is he gonna like uh
00:22:45.500 okay and we've got worm demons but my
00:22:48.900 personal favorite obstacle is definitely
00:22:50.280 the gigantic [ __ ] off laser there are of
00:22:52.860 course even more enemies but most of
00:22:54.360 them are just liberal propaganda to make
00:22:56.100 you believe that race mixing is a
00:22:57.419 physical need and fellas it's working
00:22:59.280 but hey the desert isn't all that bad as
00:23:01.740 long as you ignore the racist Genie
00:23:03.360 Quest the [ __ ] graduated from
00:23:04.799 casual to competitive racism all right
00:23:06.840 later Max what
00:23:08.940 wait I gotta go AFK real quick no you
00:23:12.419 can't do this to me look the point is
00:23:14.580 Subaru is massive and it's not even done
00:23:16.919 and also leeway isn't done and also
00:23:19.380 monstad but what sumero does have is an
00:23:21.900 actually good story like out of all the
00:23:23.640 things I expected Harvard building and
00:23:25.200 Evangelion was not one of them
00:23:30.120 you can't tell me what to do anymore Mom
00:23:32.340 I'm finally inside of another man
00:23:35.059 I am the all-knowing god Jesus Christ
00:23:38.940 they really made this boss fight a
00:23:40.679 mobile game by the way so whether you're
00:23:42.419 exploring deep in the woods at 4am
00:23:44.159 finding amazing Oasis God I sure hope
00:23:46.740 nothing Whimsical happens here I'm
00:23:48.659 fighting more minorities I'm trying to
00:23:50.640 be a police officer or doing the eight
00:23:52.620 hour gnome people Quest that is a that
00:23:55.260 is a lot of side quests there will
00:23:56.820 always be a new surprise in sumero and
00:23:58.740 the future content is even a fraction as
00:24:00.480 good as this then I'm going to be
00:24:01.679 playing this game for a very long time
00:24:03.299 because you know I wasn't doing that
